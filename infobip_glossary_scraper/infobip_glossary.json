Learn about 2FA and how it can help you protect your customers. | Dan Mekinec | Senior Content Marketing Specialist | 2FA is short for Two Factor Authentication.It refers to a security process that requires users to provide two forms of identification to verify their identity before accessing an account or making a transaction. This extra layer of security typically involves using an online password and another device, like a mobile phone. | The most popular form of 2FA is when a customer logs in to their account using a password, after which they receive aone time pin (OTP)to confirm their identity. An OTP or 2FA PIN is a code that is automatically generated and sent, usually to a mobile device, to allow a single login session or transaction. | Here is an example of a 2FA process where customers can choose the channel they want to use for authentication: | Step 1:Users initiate the 2FA process and see a prompt asking them which channel they want to use. | Step 2:After choosing the channel, users receive their verification code. | Step 3:Users enter the verification code in the app or web, authenticating the transaction. | The main benefit of 2FA is that it provides anextra layer of security,making it harder for attackers to access accounts. Simply adding a layer of 2FA to logins and transaction processes can alleviate risks of stolen data.According to Verizon,80% of cyber breachescould be prevented by 2FA. | As a method ofmulti factor authentication (MFA), it helps ensure online accounts and transactions are safe from fraudsters\u2019 many tactics, including email phishing,smishing, andSIM swapping.Google reportedthat 100% of automated bots, 99% of phishing attacks, and 66% of targeted attacks wereblocked by two factor authentication. | 99% | of phishing attacks were blocked by 2FA. Source:Google | Here is an overview of the benefits of 2FA in more detail: | It\u2019s not easy for a hacker to bypass 2FA, making it an effective security tool against fraud. Hackers would have to know lots of information to gain access and duplicate information, not just one password. | Turning on two factor authentication is an easy way to stay protected. Even the simplest form of 2FA puts a practicallyimpenetrable wallbetween hackers and your customers\u2019 personal information. | Taking these steps to protect your customers\u2019 accounts will offer them the highest level of security and the best UX, creating happy and secure customers all around. | The goal of 2FA is to secure personal information while still providing asmooth user experience. In the case ofpush notifications, there\u2019s no need to enter a PIN to confirm the authentication. A simple click is all that\u2019s required. | Tip: Using anomnichannel 2FA solution, you can allow customers to choose the channel that best suits them, putting UX and security first. | Example of anOTP code delivered on WhatsApp. | Companies that embracenew technologyare likely to experience better productivity and flexibility. Customers can sign up for services faster and more securely than before. | Today, businesses use 2FA so their employees can securely access corporate applications, data, documents, and back office systems from virtually any location without putting company data at risk. | Implementing 2FA can help reduce the lengthy and costly password reset calls and can act as a secure way for customers to sort these issues out themselves. | Reducing customer interactions with call centers, not only strengthens security but also improves UX. Then, as a massive bonus, operational overheads that are associated with security controls are reduced. | Havingstronger security measures for ecommerce sites increases consumers\u2019 trust. Consumers are more likely to trust other consumers on sites like eBay or PayPal knowing that everyone on the system must pass through the same tight security as they did. Building a large circle of trust within the community\u2014especially with services like eBay and Etsy\u2014is essential to these services\u2019 long term success. | It is common and crucial for banks and financial institutions to use 2FA services. From requiring a PIN to access your bank card, to a TOTP (time based one time password) to finalize money transfers, 2FA keeps customers\u2019 banking information safe and secure. | Related customer story: | 20% | 20%month on month registered user growth | Online retailers often use 2FA during the login process. When credit card information can be saved and stored on their accounts, adding an extra layer of protection is essential for customers to feel safe buying from their sites. | Healthcare organizations are responsible for securing patient data and information. Using 2FA, they can reassure their patients that only they can access their medical records. 2FA is also required for doctors to access patient files. | Governments have had to shift to using online and cloud based platforms for people to access their government accounts. This can include anything from student loan accounts, retirement savings, applications for driver\u2019s licenses, and other government services. | Using 2FA offers the safest and most user friendly experience. People can now securely access many government documents and records online without hassle. This makes using government sites easier than ever. | With almost 100%mobile phone ownershipin most major markets, OTP (PIN codes) sent to a mobile device isthe most common method of 2FA implementation. | However, it is crucial to choose the best channel for sending the PIN, depending on the individual use case and the preferences of each customer. | For example, some people may live or work in places with unreliable mobile or data signals. So, configuring afailover channelis key to ensuring that codes are delivered securely and before they expire in cases where time based one time PINs (TOTPs) are used. | The most popular methods of 2FA include: | You should ensure 2FA is used as effectively and efficiently as possible to ensure your customers do not get inconvenienced and associate increased security with increased hassle. | An effective authentication solution should be able toautomatically select the best primary and failover channeland trigger delivery of the OTP on the second channel when the first is not successful. This ensures that 2FA PIN codes are always delivered. | This is where aflexible omnichannel authentication solutionbecomes crucial, as it reduces the overall overhead for the organization by ensuring that human intervention is only required when necessary. | If a person is impatient to receive an OTP they might click on the \u2018send a new code\u2019 option. Every time a person does this it translates to additional costs for your business. | An effective 2FA re send strategy incorporates a set of rules for requesting OTPs that balances the security of the customer with the costs for the business. | For example, how often can a user request a new verification PIN? Will all PINs be sent via the same channel? Can the same PIN be reused? All these questions are covered by an effective 2FA resend strategy. | The benefits of a 2FA resend strategy are clear: | Checklist for creating a resend strategy | 1. Give users the option to select their preferred method of OTP delivery | By giving users choice it allows them to select the best option in situations where they may not have access to a mobile or data signal. This increases delivery rates and reduces costs as it reduces OTP resend requests. | Offer at least two of the most common options \u2013 SMS, WhatsApp, Voice, Email, or push notifications from your app. | 2. Set a time limit before allowing a resend request | The sweet spot for a buffer period is generally between 30 to 60 seconds for the first attempt and 60 to 90 seconds for the second attempt. After that, you can extend to a slightly longer time, for example 5 minutes. | A good option is to change the color of the \u2018Re send verification code\u2019 button or grey it out until the buffer period is up. In addition, you could add a timer so that the user knows when they will be able to request a new code. | 3. Restrict the number of PINs that can be sent per day | This is an important tactic to preventSMS pumping fraudwhich happens when fraudsters use bots to make multiple fake OTP requests to a business, causing a spike in their costs. To prevent this, you can restrict the number of PINs a user can request in a single day. For example, if they select five or more the service is temporarily blocked for 24 hours. | Where the service is temporarily blocked, it is important to offer an alternative for genuine users to resolve their problem, such as a chatbot, FAQ link, or helpdesk service. | 4. After a failed attempt ask users to verify their e mail/phone number | If a person enters the wrong phone number, they will never be able to receive the PIN number needed to complete the verification. To prevent this, you should ask the user to check or even re enter their email or phone number. | Another option is to use a solution such asNumber Lookup, which analyzes whether a number exists, whether it is a landline, and whether it is active before any kind of PIN is sent. You can then give genuine users the best chance to enter a valid number to receive their PIN. | 5. Set a time limit on your OTPs | It is very important that you restrict the time that a PIN code is valid for. The exact time period will depend on the type and value of the transaction \u2013 for a high value transaction the code should expire after a shorter period to reduce the chances of fraud. | Once the code has expired the user will have to request a new one to complete the verification process. | 6. Invalidate existing OTPs as soon as a new one is sent | If a user requests a new verification code, it is essential that you invalidate the code previously sent to prevent it being intercepted. This is especially relevant if your customer has changed channels between the first and second attempt. | 7. Monitor your OTP delivery metrics | To mitigate the effect of a fraud attack and to control costs you should continually monitor the metrics related to the delivery of your OTPs. It is especially important to look at the ratio between how many PINs were sent and how many were actually used. This should remain fairly steady; any significant jump in the ratio may indicate a fraud attack. | When monitoring your OTP delivery status, it is worth separating the data by channel. Measuring conversion rates across channels will give you insights into how your customers are using your 2FA service and how you can fine tune your strategy to provide a better CX and reduce costs. | Withconversion tracking,you can measurehow many PINS are sent versus how many are used. This allows you to understand how your customers are using your 2FA service and how convenient it is for them. This additional insight can help you optimize your 2FA service, and make it easier to use. | Besides OTP code delivery, other important components of mobile 2FA security are performed silently in the background, strengthening the authentication process. | For example,Number Lookupis a great way to reduce costs and ensure a customer receives their PIN. By checking thestatus of a person\u2019s phone number, you can ensure your customers receive their PIN on the channel that best suits them. | ForOTTbusinesses, if a customer enters the wrong phone number, they can never get the SMS with the PIN number necessary to complete the installation. They could lose an excellent way to stay in touch with their friends, while the app makers lose a potential user. Bearing in mind the intense competition in the messaging space, this is likely to be the last thing app makers want. | By offering detailed insight into mobile networks tocheck numbers for validity, number lookup is extremely beneficial to OTT providers. It can provide insight on if a number is nonexistent, unused or landline phone and offers customers the chance to re enter their phone number if it is incorrect. | Other security & fraud prevention services we recommend with 2FA: | At Infobip, we help businesses from global brands to independent retailers secure their customers and transactions.

In this scenario, it is theoretically possible that it could be used to access an account or validate a transaction if the person in possession of the phone also knew the rightful owner\u2019s login details and password. | To add even more layers of security,biometric checkscan also be used, for example fingerprint, retina or face scans. Many modern smartphones already have biometric capabilities, although it can be quite challenging to integrate with every service. This is why solutions likeSMS OTPare still dominant worldwide. | How is 2FA better than passwords? | Remembering multiple passwords for every service can be frustrating. Many people get around this byusing the same password for multiple accounts\u2013 even those with less stringent security. This is a bad idea. | According to Verizon, in 2021, 82% of data breaches were due to poor password security that makes it easier for hackers to guess and access your data and information. | Here are somecommon mistakespeople make when creating a password: | Organizations can mitigate the risk by requiring customers to use longer and more complex passwords that are changed regularly. However, this will impact the customer experience by adding friction and annoyance. | Two factor authentication (2FA) solves this problem, especially with mobile devices always nearby as a quick means of verifying. | What are authentication factors? | Authentication factors are pieces of information you need to gain access to an account or make a transaction. | The first authentication factor required is simple \u2013 your username and password. However, on their own these do not provide sufficient security as they can often be guessed or stolen when hackers access an organization\u2019s database that stores this information. | This is where multi factor (or multi step) authentication becomes crucial. In the case of 2FA, it requires two factors of authentication to verify your identity before you can complete an action. | There are three main types of authentication factors: | The most secure authentication solutions make use of multiple factors to suit each use case, and where OTPs are used \u2013 these can be sent on the best channel to ensure reliable deliverability and optimized costs for the organization. | What is 2FA pin? | A 2FA PIN is a code that is automatically generated and sent, usually to a mobile device, to allow a single login session or transaction.

Carriers identify these devices to determine what network connection should be attributed to them (IP address attribution, security methods, and how and whether they should be connected to private customer networks). | APNs identify the packet data network (PDN) that mobile data users wish to communicate with. In addition to identifying a PDN, an Access Point Name may also be used to define the type of service (e.g., connection to a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) server,Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS))that the PDN provides. APN is used in 3GPP data access networks). | An Access Point Name has a specific structure that helps mobile networks identify and connect devices to the appropriate data networks. | Network identifier: Specifies which external network the device is connecting to. This determines where to route the device\u2019s data traffic. | Operator identifier: Identifies the specificMobile Network Operator (MNO)associated with the gateway. | A standard Access Point Name structure looks like this: | internet.mnc280.mcc234.gprs | Whether you need a private APN for your IoT deployment depends on a few crucial factors: | Here\u2019s a breakdown of the challenges you might face if your APN settings are incorrect: | No data connection: The most common problem. With the wrong Access Point Name, your device won\u2019t be able to establish a data connection with your mobile carrier\u2019s network. This prevents you from accessing the internet or using data related apps. | Connection instability: In some cases, an incorrect APN might let you connect, but the connection will be unreliable, with frequent drops or slow speeds. | MMS issues: Incorrect MMS settings within the APN can block you from sending or receiving picture and video messages. | Tethering problems: If you want to use your phone\u2019s data as a hotspot for other devices, incorrect APN settings can prevent this from working. | Carrier specific services: Some carriers have unique services (like visual voicemail or specific apps) that rely on configuring the correct APN. | Roaming charges: If traveling, an incorrect APN might prevent your device from connecting to the optimal local network, leading to unexpected and costly roaming fees. | Data overages: Without the correct Access Point Name, your device might inadvertently connect using a network with data charges different from what you expect. | Isolating the issue: When your internet doesn\u2019t work, an incorrect APN might not be the first culprit that comes to mind. This makes the problem more challenging to diagnose for users not familiar with APN settings. | The severity of the problem depends on how incorrect the APN is. A single typo might cause limited issues, while a wrong APN usually blocks data entirely. | Some carriers auto configure APN settings, but there are still situations where manual input is needed (e.g., custom APNs, someMVNOs). | Here\u2019s a step by step approach to resolve APN related challenges on your device: | Find the correct APN: Start by checking that the APN settings match those provided by your carrier. You\u2019ll usually find this information on the carrier\u2019s website or by contacting their support. | Check for typos: Carefully compare your current Access Point Name settings against the correct ones, watching for typos or incorrect values. Even a minor error can cause connectivity issues. | Built in reset: Most devices can reset Access Point Name settings to their default. This can often resolve minor discrepancies if the correct values aren\u2019t readily available. | Caution: If you have a custom Access Point Name, resetting to default might clear the settings you want to keep \u2013 make a note of them first if needed. | Careful input: If you have the correct APN information from your carrier and previous steps didn\u2019t work, input everything manually. Ensure all fields are filled in accurately. | Double check: Before saving, meticulously compare the values you entered against the information provided by your carrier. | Persistent issues: If the above steps fail to resolve the problem, contacting your carrier\u2019s technical support is best. They may have additional troubleshooting steps or device specific guidance. | Account issues: Sometimes connectivity problems stem from account or provisioning issues, which only the carrier can address. | An Access Point Name is a gateway that allows you to connect to the Internet through your carrier network. In comparison,VPN stands for Virtual Private Network, a technology that creates a secure connection to another network over the Internet. | Does a VPN make me completely anonymous? | No, it significantly improves privacy but isn\u2019t foolproof. Combine it with other good online security practices. | Can my employer see my activity if I\u2019m using their VPN? | Yes, work provided VPNs often allow traffic to be monitored for security purposes. | Can a VPN protect me from viruses? | No, VPNs primarily secure your data in transit. Still, use antivirus software. | Share | December 12, 2023 | November 14, 2023 | March 29, 2023"

It is easier for customers to recognize the sender of the message. The BIMI framework has protection against illegitimate senders spoofing logos. | Better engagement:From a marketing perspective, it makes your message stand out and encourages receivers to open your emails. | If your company wants to implement BIMI, you must create and publish a new DNS (Domain Name System) record with a URL to your business\u2019s logo. When the mailbox provider checks your DMARC, it will look for a BIMI record. If the record matches, they will display the logo next to your email. | Since BIMI is a relatively new technology, inbox providers that support BIMI as of June 2023 are Apple Mail, Google, Yahoo, Fastmail, Cloudmark, La Poste, Onet Poczta, and Zone. Providers considering BIMI include Yahoo Japan, GMX, Web.de, Seznam, Qualitia, Comcast, BT Mail, and Atmail. | Before implementing BIMI, you\u2019ll need to do the following steps: | The first step, and the most important one, is setting up DMARC. All your emails must be authenticated usingSPFand/orDKIM. Once that is completed, the DMARC checks that the domain in SPF and/or DKIM check matches the sender\u2019s domain in the From field and specifies how providers should deliver it if the message fails both SPF and DKIM \u2013 accept, reject, or mark it as spam. | Next, you\u2019ll need to create a BIMI logo image. You should pay attention to how to format the file. The recommended size is a square. | After that, you should update your DNS with logo information. | Share | October 4, 2023 | January 22, 2023 | March 20, 2019"

This makes the components simultaneously available, helps your organization\u2019s resilience, and provides better protection. | Geo redundancy protects your data and minimizes downtime by replicating your organization\u2019s data and IT infrastructure to other sites. This helps to ensure that applications and workloads remain available during an outage or disaster. | In a production use case, it provides help in minimizing network connectivity issues and downtime and ensures traffic is transferred to alternate nodes if one fails or needs to undergo routine maintenance. In a backup use case, geo redundancy enables the recovery of applications and workloads in case of an outage in your current location. | There are three types of Geo redundancy: | Redundancyimplies the presence of redundant backup servers that are on standby and ready to take over if the primary server fails.Failoveris the action of switching to a backup server or network in the case of failure. | Redundancyand backups are similar but different.Backupsare used for exact copies of data. They store and keep your business operational in case of data loss. While redundancy also does that but also ensures the continuity of network, applications, data, storage, power, etc., in the event of a disaster or data loss. | High availabilitymeans all systems and resources are always on and available. Whileredundancydoes not equal high availability, it ensures that additional resources are ready in case of system failure. | Share | February 6, 2023"

No two SIM cards have the same ICCID number. | The ICCID is a globally unique serial number \u2013 a one of a kind signature that identifies the SIM card itself. It is used in the Infobip IoT module and in reporting to identify IoT sims. | MNOsuse the ICCID to identify the correct network to connect your device, authenticate it, and ensure you get the right services. The ICCID helps MNOs and IoT service providers manage many connected devices. It makes it easy to identify, track, activate, and troubleshoot individual SIMs on a network. | The format for ICCID Number isMMCC IINN NNNN NNNN NN C x. | Integrated circuit card identifier serves several crucial purposes within cellular networks, especially forMobile Network Operators (MNOs)and IoT deployments. Here\u2019s a breakdown of its primary functions: | People often use \u201cSIM card number\u201d in everyday conversation to refer to the ICCID. This is not technically incorrect; the integrated circuit card ID functions as the SIM card\u2019s identifying number. | While the terms are often used interchangeably, sometimes understanding the difference can be helpful: | One ICCID per SIM: Each physical SIM card is manufactured with a single, permanent ICCID. This creates a one to one relationship between the physical SIM and its identifier. | This simple concept has well established processes for ICCID generation and management by MNOs. | Switching carriers requires getting a new SIM card with a new ICCID, which means less flexibility in managing multiple profiles or networks. | eSIMs allow users to switch between carriers or use various networks simultaneously (if the device supports it). This enhances roaming options and competition among MNOs. | eUICCIDis a unique identifier for the physical eSIM hardware. It\u2019s analogous to the fixed ICCID on traditional SIM cards. | An eSIM is a chip soldered directly onto a device\u2019s motherboard. It introduces a new identifier called the eUICCID, which identifies the physical eSIM hardware. | The relationship between physical hardware and ICCIDs becomes less straightforward. While there\u2019s still a one to one relationship between a physical eSIM and its eUICCID, a single eSIM can now hold multiple ICCIDs. | eSIMs use the eUICC (Embedded Universal Integrated Circuit Card) software. The eUICC manages SIM profiles, and each profile can have its own unique ICCID. A single eSIM can hold multiple ICCIDs associated with different carriers or subscriptions. | Over the air (OTA)management allows MNOs to remotely change profiles and their associated ICCIDs on an eSIM without physically swapping cards. | TheInternational Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)is a number that identifies your specific subscriber account and service plan. It\u2019s like your cellular \u2018profile.\u2019 | For example, a SIM can store multiple IMSIs when roaming or with multi network SIMs. | When your device connects to a network: | In the world of IoT, both ICCID and IMSI are crucial: | The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI)identifies the device, while ICCID identifies the SIM card. | The ICCID and the IMEI authenticate your device on the network, ensuring that both the SIM card and device are authorized. | In the case of a stolen device, the IMEI is the primary way for networks to block it from future use. The ICCID is used in tandem to ensure a stolen SIM isn\u2019t used with a different device. | Since the ICCID number is used to manage SIM cards, locating it is crucial. It is usually on the card itself or printed on the packaging. Also, you can find the number when inserting a SIM card into a device and going to the settings menu (General > About). | For the IoT devices, you can create a query through an AT command based on the IoT mobile network module used in the device: | How do you find ICCID on an Android phone? | How to find ICCID on iPhone? | To find your ICCID on your iPhone, go to Settings > General > About > ICCID. | Can the ICCID be changed? | No. The ICCID is permanently assigned to a physical SIM card and can\u2019t be altered. | Do I need to worry about ICCID security? | Be aware ofSIM swapfraud \u2013 scammers try to take over your number using your ICCID. | Choose a cellular provider with solid security measures to protect your ICCID. | Share | January 20, 2023 | January 18, 2023"

It\u2019s a core component that enables LAMs to go beyond passive language processing and become active problem solvers. | The term LAM is sometimes used interchangeably with AI agent. AI agents are software programs that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. LAMs can be seen as a type of AI agent that useslarge language models (LLMs)for advanced language understanding and action planning. | 1. Foundation layer:LAMs often begin by integrating a powerful existing large language model. This LLM is fine tuned with specific data to prepare it for the LAM\u2019s unique purpose. This foundation allows the LAM to understand natural language and figure out what the user wants. | 2. Multimodal input processing:LAMs can handle more than just text. They can also process images and potentially even user interactions. Special techniques are used to analyze text and extract key information. | 3. Goal inference:The LAM analyzes the user\u2019s request, considering things like their past behavior and what\u2019s happening in the application they\u2019re using. This helps the LAM understand the user\u2019s true goal, which might be more than what they literally said. | 4. Understand the user interface:LAMs use computer vision to interpret visual information from application interfaces. They can recognize things like buttons and menus and understand how these elements work within the application. | 5. Breaks down tasks and plans actions:Once the LAM understands the goal, it breaks it down into smaller, actionable subtasks. It then creates a plan, prioritizing actions based on efficiency, user preferences, and learned rules of thumb. | 6. Decision making and reasoning:LAMs use advanced algorithms that combine neural networks and symbolic AI techniques for decision making. This allows them to use pattern recognition and logical reasoning to determine the best action. | 7. Execute tasks:LAMs interact with external systems using tools like web automation frameworks. They can simulate user actions like clicking, typing, or navigating between pages. Some LAMs can also directly interact with other software systems. | 8. Continuously learning and human oversight:LAMs use variousmachine learningtechniques to improve with each interaction. Many LAMs also allow for human oversight, enabling intervention in complex scenarios. | LAMs have the potential to automate a wide range of tasks, including: | LAMs often have LLMs at their core. LLMs excel at understanding and generating human like text. This allows LAMs to: | Even with all the similarities and overlaps between the concepts of LAM and LLM, here\u2019s a more in depth look at their key differences: | LAMs have potential applications across various industries, including: | What are the ethical considerations surrounding LAMs? | It\u2019s important to address ethical considerations like potential bias in decision making, the impact on employment, and the responsible use of LAMs in sensitive areas like healthcare and finance. | What is the future of LAMs? | As LAMs continue to evolve, we can expect to see them become more sophisticated, capable, and integrated into various aspects of our lives. They hold the potential to transform how we interact with technology and automate complex tasks, leading to increased efficiency and productivity. | Level up your AI and machine learning knowledge in 2025 with our curated list of the best free courses and resources available on the web. | As the buzz around GenAI starts to fizzle, has it lived up to our high expectations, and what does the future look like for GenAI? | Find out how humans play a critical role in successful AI systems and the ways AI can complement human work, instead of replace it. | Share"

These sensors can measure things like: | The devices need a way to transmit the collected data. This is achieved through a network, which could be: | The transmitted data arrives at a central software platform or application. This software does the following: | Imagine a machine on a factory floor equipped with temperature and vibration sensors.If the software detects the machine overheating or unusual vibrations, it might send a maintenance alert to technicians or even preemptively shut down the machine to prevent damage. | The most common examples of M2M technology are: | M2M communication focuses on direct communication between devices, minimizing the need for manual intervention. | Machine to machine systems rely heavily on sensors to gather data about the environment, machine status, inventory levels, etc. | M2M connections utilize various networks to transmit data, including cellular, WiFi, and specialized low power networks (e.g., LoRaWAN, Sigfox). | M2M devices are often deployed in remote locations and need to operate for extended periods. Therefore, they\u2019re designed to conserve power. | Machine to machine communications typically involve transferring relatively small amounts of data regularly (i.e., sensor readings and status updates). | M2M systems often operate in mission critical applications, so the connections and underlying networks must be highly reliable. | Due to the sensitivity of the data often transmitted, machine to machine connections prioritize security features to prevent unauthorized access or interception. | M2M enables remote monitoring of devices and assets, even in hard to reach locations. It also allows for remote control or configuration changes. | Think of machine to machine communication as a building block within the larger IoT ecosystem.M2M provides the core capability for devices to communicate. IoT expands on that by enabling wider connectivity, intelligent data analysis, and the creation of innovative services and applications across many sectors. | Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key differences between the two: | IoT:The IoT is a broader concept encompassing a vast network of interconnected things, including consumer devices, industrial equipment, wearables, vehicles, and more. It focuses on the power of widespread connectivity and data sharing at a large scale. | M2M:Machine to machine focuses on direct communication between machines, often within specific industries or applications. It\u2019s a foundational component of the IoT. | IoT:IoT systems often involve more complex architectures with multiple layers of devices, networks, cloud platforms, and data analytics. They can handle larger amounts of data and provide insights across various domains. | M2M:M2M systems tend to be more focused and streamlined, with a specific communication path between machines. | IoT:IoT emphasizes the ability of diverse devices and systems to communicate and exchange information seamlessly. It promotes open standards and protocols. | M2M:While interoperability is important within machine to machine systems, it may be limited to specific devices or standards within a particular application. | IoT:The IoT enables a wide range of applications, including smart homes, smart cities, connected healthcare, intelligent logistics, and complex industrial automation. | M2M:M2M is traditionally used in remote asset monitoring, fleet management, industrial automation, and point of sale systems applications. | Machine to machine communication presents unique security challenges and requires careful consideration. | M2M systems often control critical infrastructure or handle sensitive data (e.g., healthcare, energy grids, industrial processes). A security breach could have serious consequences, including financial losses, operational disruptions, or safety hazards. | M2M devices are often deployed in remote or unattended locations, making them harder to secure and monitor physically. | The diversity of devices, communication protocols, and networks in machine to machine systems increases the number of potential attack points. | Many M2M devices have limited computational power and memory, making it harder to implement robust security measures. | Simple passwords or lack of authentication leave devices vulnerable to unauthorized access. | Data transmitted in cleartext can be easily intercepted, especially over wireless networks. | Outdated firmware or software bugs provide openings for attackers to exploit. | Devices\u2019 inaccessible locations may be susceptible to physical tampering, allowing attackers to extract data or install malware. | M2M devices and networks can be targeted to overwhelm them with traffic, making them inaccessible to legitimate users. | Encrypt data both in transit and at rest to protect it from eavesdropping and unauthorized access. | Implement robust authentication mechanisms like multi factor authentication or certificate based authentication. | Keep device firmware and software up to date to patch vulnerabilities. | Separate machine to machine networks from other IT networks to reduce the attack surface. | Implement monitoring systems to detect and respond to suspicious activities. | Where possible, secure M2M devices in tamper resistant enclosures and restrict physical access. | Ensure secure onboarding of new devices with unique identities and trusted credentials. | What industries are the biggest users of M2M technology? | The most significant users of machine to machine technology are manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, smart cities, and utilities. | What are the typical costs involved in M2M? | Typical M2M costs include hardware, network connectivity fees, software development/licensing, and ongoing maintenance. | March 28, 2024 | March 22, 2024 | March 13, 2024 | Share"

All mobile phones can receive SMS, there is no requirement for data or an internet connection, and the fact that mobile phones usually require their own code to unlock adds even more security. | They can also be delivered through proprietary tokens, though these are less popular as they require a person to carry the token at all times. | What makes one time PIN codes so secure is that they can only be used once, and can be set to expire after a short period of time. Even though normal passwords can be very complex, they are usually only changed every few months, or sometimes never. This makes them far more susceptible to hackers and data breaches. | In the most secure solutions, one time passcodes and passwords are used together to provide the highest protection from fraud. | Using a one time password as an additional layer of authentication method provides several benefits including: | One time passwords can be generated or delivered through various methods. Here are a few examples: | They are often used in online banking for transaction verification and login authentication. | Users receive OTPs via SMS, email, or mobile apps to confirm financial transactions or log in to their accounts securely. | During online purchases or transactions, they can be used to confirm the legitimacy of the user. | This adds an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized transactions. | One time PIN codes are used for identity verification in various online services, ensuring that the person attempting access is the legitimate account holder. | This is particularly crucial in scenarios where personal information or sensitive data is involved. | They are sometimes used in the password recovery process. | Users receive a one time PIN to verify their identity before resetting a forgotten password. | In healthcare systems, they can be employed to secure access to patient records or other sensitive healthcare data. | This helps maintain the confidentiality and integrity of healthcare information. | Your customers\u2019 security should be one of your highest priorities.

This hash is what gets stored in a website\u2019s database. Even if a hacker were to steal that database, they wouldn\u2019t see your actual password. | Use this analogy: your password is a secret ingredient in a recipe. You wouldn\u2019t write that ingredient down in plain English in your cookbook, right? The same goes for passwords. | Here\u2019s how password hashing is used to grant access while keeping your password secure: | No plain text: Your real password is never stored, so even if a hacker gains access to the database, they won\u2019t find passwords in a readable form. | Let\u2019s say your password is \u201cP@ssw0rd123\u201d. A hashing algorithm might turn it into something like \u201ca94a8fe5ccb19ba61c4c0873d391e987982fbbd3\u201d. This hash is what gets stored. When you log in and re enter \u201cP@ssw0rd123\u201d, the system re hashes it and sees that it matches the stored hash, allowing you in. | Password salting is a security technique used to make password hashes even more resistant to cracking. | Let\u2019s say your password is \u201cpassword123.\u201d | Even if someone else has the same \u201cpassword123,\u201d their salt will differ, resulting in a unique hash. | Salted passwords should be stored in a secure database alongside their corresponding salts. | While hash functions are a powerful tool in cryptography and security, they have some inherent limitations that are important to be aware of: | Hashing is used to verify that data hasn\u2019t been altered and to store passwords securely. Encryption is used to keep data private during transmission or storage. While both are important security tools, they serve different purposes and shouldn\u2019t be confused or used interchangeably. | Hashing is an essential tool for password security, but it\u2019s most effective when used with other security measures. Using a multi layered approach, website owners can significantly reduce the risk of password compromise and protect their users\u2019 sensitive information. | Ensuring secure password security involves a combination of user best practices and sound system level implementations. | Users should prioritize creating strong, unique passwords at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoiding personal information and utilizing password managers can further bolster security. Enablingtwo factor authentication (2FA)provides extra protection against unauthorized access. | Can a hashed password be decrypted to get the original password? | No, hashing is a one way function. It\u2019s designed to be irreversible, so it\u2019s practically impossible to recover the original password from a hash. This is why it\u2019s important to choose a strong hashing algorithm and salt passwords. | Can I use hashing to protect other types of sensitive data besides passwords? | Yes, hashing can be used to protect various types of data, such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, or any other information you want to keep confidential. However, for data that needs to be retrievable in its original form, encryption is a more appropriate solution. | Is hashing enough to protect my passwords from all attacks? | While hashing is a crucial security measure, it\u2019s not foolproof. Other security practices, such as strong password policies, two factor authentication, and regular security audits, are also essential to ensure comprehensive password protection. | Zero trust security assumes no user, device, or network traffic should be trusted by default, even within the organization\u2019s network. | Risk based authentication (RBA) dynamically assesses the risk level of each login attempt or transaction based on the risk and context. | Passwordless authentication is a way to identify your identity without using a password. Instead, it uses more secure alternatives like possession factors or biometrics. | Discover the challenges and solutions for secure conversational banking.

RCS is used forperson to person(P2P) andapplication to person(A2P) communications. | RCS messaging might also be referred to as: | Thirty years ago,SMSreformed communication, allowing us to send short text messages instantly across the globe. It was a groundbreaking innovation that changed how we connect. But technology, like time, marches on. User expectations have matured, demanding richer, more dynamic ways to interact. | While SMS and its multimedia counterpart, MMS, were pioneers, they now face limitations in a world accustomed to feature rich messaging apps. | SMS (Short Message Service):Confined to 160 characters, SMS struggles to convey complex information or express emotions effectively. | MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service):Although MMS allows for sharing images and videos, it\u2019s often hampered by low resolution and file size restrictions, hindering its ability to deliver truly engaging content. | Rich Communication Servicesemerged to bridge this gap and modernize mobile messaging, offering a more versatile and feature rich experience. | RCS aims to be the future of mobile messaging by offering: | RCS is based on Universal Profile, a set of standards developed by the GSMA to ensure interoperability between different carriers and devices. It relies on IP based technology, similar to chat apps, but is delivered through mobile network operators. | Widespread adoption of Rich Communication Services depends on the support of both carriers and device manufacturers. Carriers play a crucial role in enabling RCS on their networks, while device manufacturers need to ensure their phones are compatible with the Universal Profile. | The good news is that RCS is gaining significant momentum.

The judgement declared that companies must comply with applicable EU law and must ensure an adequate level of data protection when transferring personal data to third countries (read as: outside of EU/EEA andadequate countries). | The essence of the Schrems II judgement is that businesses need to control in which country they store their customer\u2019s personal data and, to which countries is this personal data transferred to, and from which countries it\u2019s being accessed. Choosing a provider which can accommodate this will enable businesses to be compliant. | Schrems II benefits end users by providing greater protection for their personal data. The ruling requires businesses to assess the risk associated with data transfers and implement measures that ensure the protection of personal data. | This means that end users can have greater confidence in the businesses they interact with, knowing that their personal data is being accessed only from countries which provide adequate protection. | Schrems II is a significant ruling that has wide ranging implications for businesses and end users. By promoting greater accountability, the ruling has the potential to improve data protection practices and promote privacy rights. Businesses that comply with the ruling can build trust with customers and enhance their reputation in the marketplace. End users can feel confident that their personal data is being protected, which can promote greater confidence and trust in the companies they interact with. | May 9, 2023 | February 24, 2023 | Share"

Forrester\u2019s research and publications on zero trust have been instrumental in shaping the understanding and adoption of this approach. They have developed the Zero Trust eXtended (ZTX) framework, which provides a comprehensive approach to implementing zero trust in organizations. | In practice, zero trust security works by implementing multiple security measures that continuously assessriskand grant access based on a dynamic trust evaluation. Here\u2019s how it works: | Passwordless authentication is a way to identify your identity without using a password. Instead, it uses more secure alternatives like possession factors or biometrics. | Adopting a zero trust architecture offers numerous benefits for organizations of all sizes, helping them strengthen their security posture and protect their valuable assets: | Zero trust architecture can be applied to various scenarios, offering enhanced security and risk mitigation across different areas: | Developing a robust zero trust strategy requires a thoughtful and systematic approach. Here\u2019s how to start: | How is zero trust different from traditional security? | Traditional security is like a castle with a moat\u2014it focuses on protecting the perimeter but assumes everything inside is safe. Zero trust, on the other hand, acknowledges that threats can come from anywhere, even within the organization. It\u2019s about continuously monitoring and verifying everyone and everything, not just at the entrance. | Is zero trust only for big companies? | Not at all! Zero trust principles can be adapted to organizations of any size. | Isn\u2019t zero trust too complex and expensive? | It doesn\u2019t have to be. Zero trust can be implemented incrementally, starting with the most critical assets and gradually expanding to other areas. | Multifactor authentication (MFA) is a security method that requires users to provide 2 or more verification factors to access an account. | Password hashing is a process that transforms your password into a jumbled, unrecognizable string of characters (the \u201chash\u201d). | Risk based authentication (RBA) dynamically assesses the risk level of each login attempt or transaction based on the risk and context. | Passwordless authentication is a way to identify your identity without using a password.
