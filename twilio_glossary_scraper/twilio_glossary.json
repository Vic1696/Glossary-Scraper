The set includes all the English lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers from 0 to 9, and symbols such as.,!, and@. | The first 32 values, 0 through 31, are reserved for terminal control codes, such as Escape, New Line, Carriage Return, and Acknowledge. | The reason the characters are encoded as 7 bit values is because early computers handled data in bytes \u2014 blocks of 8 bits. The extra, eighth bit was originally reserved for error checking. Computers can only process numbers, so text characters need to represented by numbers too. Ascii was devised to ensure that when any machine output, say, the value 65 as text, it presented anA. Before Ascii, different computers used their own encodings, so textual information was difficult to transfer between machines from different manufacturers. | Today, SendGrid requires 7 bit encoding in ourSMTPAPI categories header(link takes you to an external page). | For more information on Ascii, visit Wikipedia for the entirehistory of the standard(link takes you to an external page). |  | "

The word stems from the Middle English cry \"Hoy!\", a greeting derived from the Dutch \"Hoi\". | Seafarers used the word 'ahoy' in song well before the word's first recorded use in print. The term was first referenced as a new nautical term in the 1751 novelThe Adventures of Peregrine Pickle(link takes you to an external page)by Tobias Smollett. In its early usage, 'ahoy' was used as both an exclamation and a way to get someone's attention. By 1813, 'ahoy' was a widely used word in the English language, and the first half of the 19th Century brought the term (or a close variant) to neighboring languages. 'Ahoy' soon became a popular greeting outside of nautical situations. | While 'ahoy' fell out of the popular English lexicon for a time, the word later rose from obscurity as the sport of sailing grew in popularity. 'Ahoy' can still be heard used as a greeting, a warning, or to say farewell. | While 'hello' is the standard English language greeting today, the word has only been around since 1827. In its early days, 'hello' was used to attract attention or express surprise, as in, \"Well, hello, what have we here?\" | 'Hello' didn't become the standard greeting as we know it today until the arrival of the telephone.Thomas Edison(link takes you to an external page)urged people to say 'hello' when answering his phone. | Alexander Graham Bell(link takes you to an external page), the Scottish born innovator credited with patenting the first commercial telephone, originally suggested 'Ahoy hoy' as the standard greeting when answering the telephone. 'Ahoy' had been around at least 100 years longer than 'hello', and its nautical origins along with common usage as a greeting made it a strong candidate. | Thede factotelephone greeting we know and use today was solidified after the first telephone books sanctioned 'hello' as the official greeting in their authoritative How To... sections. 'Hello' quickly eclipsed 'ahoy', but Bell insisted upon answering the phone with 'ahoy' for the rest of his life. | In pop culture,The Simpsons' Mr. Burns also answers the telephone as Mr. Bell intended: | 'Ahoy, world' is just a few lines of code away.

            "Artificial Intelligence",
            "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer to mimic human cognitive skills, such as learning and understanding. | Although still in its early stages, AI is already changing the landscape of company communications. It allows businesses to engage with larger numbers of customers without sacrificing the quality of the interaction. Today, businesses use AI to chat with customers, route calls, send emails, and more. By 2020, research company Gartner predicts that 85% of a customer's engagement with an enterprise will occur without interacting with a human being. | This is possible because of advances in machine learning \u2014 the ability of AI systems to learn and improve automatically. They do so by taking in data through observations and interactions, and adapting accordingly without being explicitly programmed. Essentially, machine learning systems program themselves. | Rapid advances in AI like machine learning are bringing many businesses opportunities forgrowth and revenue(link takes you to an external page). There are three main factors influencing this fast moving space: | AI offers multiple benefits to both customers and businesses. Among the most apparent benefits to customers is shorter hold times. AI can be used to help route callers to the right destination quickly, skipping some \u2014 or all \u2014 of the traditional phone menu. | An example of an intelligent routing system is theTwilio TaskRouter API. TaskRouter dynamically assigns messages to the human agents that can best handle them. Messages and other types of data can be routed based on the \"skills\" required and the applied priority. AI applications like this help build superior customer experiences. | For businesses, cost savings are a significant driver behind the adoption of AI for customer support. While a customer service phone call costs a business$6 20 per call(link takes you to an external page), automated calls cost, on average, 25 cents. However, the benefits of AI extend far beyond the bottom line. When automated services take care of a portion of customer service requests, agents are free to handle more complex requests. This reduces customer frustration while continuing to reduce the load on each live agent, allowing operators to specialize and give better service. | Bots are instances of software that lets a customer interact with a business through messaging. They are a common use of AI in business communications. While some bots operate on their own, many others support and augment a human agent who is representing the business. | Bots provide automated responses based on message analysis using technologies such as Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Intent Extraction. Bots can learn from human decisions, so they get better with algorithmic and data driven decisions day by day. Eventually this reduces the need for humans to step in. | When bots deliver a subpar experience compared to a human agent, companies are left to balance higher costs associated with human support agents and the negative customer satisfaction scores generated by a poor bot. It doesn't have to be this way. At Twilio, we allow you to integrate with third party bot providers to create a conversational AI interface, to bridge the gap between human agents and self service bots. | Contact centers are a hive of activity, filled with repetitive work and lots and lots of data. This is an ideal environment for AI and automation. If AI can deliver what we want it to, we can actually decrease costs while simultaneously increasing customer satisfaction. | However, we still need human agents to create intimacy with our customers. Intimacy drives customer satisfaction which creates loyalty. Loyal, satisfied customers tend to spend more money. | Ultimately, the question is notwhetherwe should be using AI, but how do weapply it appropriatelywhile still keeping that human touch. | We also need to keep our human agents happy. Agents with positive attitudes create better experiences for customers and stay with your contact center longer, reducing churn. Agent assist AI can also be useful here. Ultimately, the goal of AI is to help customers have a more personalized and efficient experience without them even noticing. AI improves agent conversations by helping to anticipate customer needs and automate actions where possible. In cases where customers can self serve, AI tools can help those interactions be more human. | Twilio Flex(link takes you to an external page)was built to allow complete customization all the way through the stack. AI can be applied at every layer. You can focus on using AI before the agent interaction, such as by building chatbots or using sentiment analysis to improve routing. Or you can use AI to assist agents during an interaction or for agent training in conjunction withworkforce optimizationanalytics. |  | "

            "Attribute Based Routing is a process used by contact center applications to distribute tasks according to a set of defined characteristics. | Attribute Based Routing intelligently steerscontact centertasks. For example, you can specify in the workflow how you want to route calls and then send voice callers to the most qualified agent based on the attributes you defined. Some examples of attributes include: | TaskRouteris Twilio's Attribute Based Routing engine. TaskRouter can route any interaction, whether it originates from Twilio or another system. | When a call, lead, chat, SMS, support ticket, messaging app request, or even machine data comes in, TaskRouter dynamically assigns the incoming task to the person and process that can best handle it. TaskRouter does so using the attributes you apply, such as the skills required by the agent and the task priority. | With TaskRouter, you can define the characteristics of each task using any number of attributes. You can also write syntax to route those tasks based on combinations of attributes, including escalation and fallback rules, so you don't have to write custom code. | Example applications for TaskRouter include: | With an attribute based routing system like TaskRouter, customer support agents and other workers are matched to tasks based on their skills. As an admin, you can specify what agent skills are required to take work from each queue and also update worker skills at any time. TaskRouter will immediately update the state and routing logic with no code changes required. | Attribute based routing engines let teams get away from the administrative work of manually routing tasks and back to what's most important \u2014 creating great customer experiences. And of course, it's easier for them to create great customer experiences when they are given tasks that match their skill set. | Attribute based routing also makes it easier for workers to multitask, since you can specify how many different tasks each agent can handle concurrently, with different limits per channel. For example, a worker might be able to handle three simultaneous chats, a voice call and a chat, or only one voice call at a time. The engine notes a worker's capacity and their activity to determine if they are available for a new task. By using incremental escalation to constantly keep track of every task in the system, wherever it is in the queue, you can define escalation logic to incrementally expand the set of agents who can be assigned to each task. | Lending platform LendUp(link takes you to an external page)implemented TaskRouter to intelligently route customers' calls to different specialists. For example: | Using TaskRouter, LendUp can write its own call routing logic, and let TaskRouter do the heavy lifting. |  | "

It's referred to as a \"call center\" because traditional models of customer service are based on phone support as the main method of contact between customers and companies. A modern call center is often referred to as acontact center. | Traditionally, a call center is an office where a large number of call center agents provide customer service over the telephone.Inbound call centersreceive calls for customer support that are initiated by customers and prospects and often serve as a knowledge base for tech support, billing questions, and other customer service issues. These call centers focus on quick call resolution times and agent productivity. Inoutbound call centers, agents make calls rather than receive them. These could be sales calls, marketing offers, surveys, fundraising requests, or debt collection, for example. | The termcontact centerreflects the reality that there are many other ways to connect with a customer besides telephone. The combined trends of increased customer expectations and newer technologies that allow formany channels of communication(link takes you to an external page)are creating a shift in thetraditional call center modelwhich has existed for decades. Consumers want more ways to reach businesses, and businesses are looking for new ways to improve customer experience. | While call center agents generally focus oninbound and outbound calls(link takes you to an external page)either on traditional phone lines or overVoIP, contact center agents handle a wide variety of communications. In a modern multichannel contact center, technical support might be delivered overin app chat(link takes you to an external page)orvideo(link takes you to an external page), while order status updates are delivered viaSMS(link takes you to an external page), event promotions are sent aspush notifications, surveys are deployed overFacebook Messenger(link takes you to an external page), and sales inquiries received by email are sent directly to an agent to connect by phone. Anomnichannelcall center takes the multichannel approach one step further and connects and integrates all channels of communication for a seamless customer experience. | In short, the difference between a call center and a contact center is that call centers handle voice communications, contact centers handleallcommunications. | Many businesses built their call centers with costly infrastructure that was expensive and time consuming to install and customize. Most legacy call center systems take an average of nine months of professional services to make even the smallest changes. It's very hard to experiment, iterate, and improve a contact center under those circumstances. In the meantime, customer expectations continue to change rapidly as new technologies and communication channels become the norm. | Today, a new approach to the traditional call center is available that allows businesses to deliver the caliber of real time customer experience necessary to win in increasingly competitive markets. Instead of taking an 'off the shelf' system from a telecom vendor and accepting inflexible systems with a monolithic feature set, thiscall center software(link takes you to an external page)approach enables companies to build the exact solution they need, when they need it. It's an approach that offers more than updated technology; it re envisions how call center operations are designed and built. | Software based on APIs allow real time customer experiences over multiple channels (voice(link takes you to an external page),chat(link takes you to an external page),SMS(link takes you to an external page),IVR, email,social media(link takes you to an external page), etc.). They act as an automatic call distributor (ACD) that canroute any taskfrom multiple sources. The ACD recognizes an incoming call and scans for predetermined identifying information. This information is cross referenced against a database of call routing instructions and distributes the call accordingly. The software maintains context of conversations and surfaces customers to the correct agent throughcomputer telephony integration (CTI)(link takes you to an external page)andWebRTC. | When you build your contact center with communication building blocks like Twilio's programmable APIs, you can choose the channels and features you need and add more as your call center expands.

A call routing system is also known as anautomatic call distributor (ACD). | Since traditional models of customer service were based on phone support as the primary method of contact between customers and companies, the procedure of sending calls to the right agent became known ascall routing. However, modern agents interact with customers through a variety of channels. Thecall centerhas evolved into thecontact center. | Today,SMS(link takes you to an external page)messages,chat(link takes you to an external page)andmessaging(link takes you to an external page)requests, support tickets, leads, or even machine data are routed based on pre set attributes, such as skills required by the agent, time zone or language preferences, and priority of the task. This process is often referred to asattribute based routing, which matches tasks to the people or processes that can best handle them. | When there's a queue of customers waiting on the line, most businesses agree: getting those customers connected to the right agent as quickly as possible is a high priority. | Call routing allows businesses to connect their customers to the right agent faster. Attribute based routing assesses the needs and context of each caller and connects them to the most qualified agent available with the skills to address those needs. Priority based routing lets businesses elevate the most important callers to the front of the queue. | Intelligent call routing (ortask routing) isn't just beneficial for customers. It also increases agent productivity by ensuring that agents are working on the right task at the right time, instead of prioritizing less urgent tasks or working on tasks that they aren't suited for. | Call routing helps customers not only have their needs met quickly, but also have an overall better experience. By anticipating customer needs and automating actions where possible, call routing creates a more personalized and efficient customer experience\u2014which has a direct impact on a business's bottom line. | Consumer research(link takes you to an external page)shows that 67% of customers will give more business to a company as a result of positive communication experiences. But after a poor communication experience, 38% of customers will switch to a competitor or cancel orders or services, 66% will tell a friend about their experience, and 41% will stop doing business with the company altogether. | In cases where human agents aren't necessary, call routing enables virtual assistants andinteractive voice response (IVR) systemsto provide instant help. In fact,Gartner(link takes you to an external page)predicts that customer preferences for independence and self service automation will likely rise to 85% by 2020. | An IVR system with custom built menus can expedite incoming calls, accurately route callers, or even schedule a callback, reducing both the cost and the time to resolution. | Becausecustomers prefer self help(link takes you to an external page)features over waiting on hold for human contact, implementing an IVR system makes good business sense. This is especially true since IVR handled calls cancost 100 times less(link takes you to an external page)than those involving a live agent. Equipped with intelligent call routing, IVR systems can reduce operating costs while increasing customer satisfaction. | Twilio TaskRouteris an example of an attribute based routing API, for calls as well as other channels of communication, such asSMS messages, or interactions from any other system such as aCRM. TaskRouter dynamically routes incoming tasks to the agents that can best handle them based on applied attributes, such as skills required by the agent and priority of the task. | Twilio chose TaskRouter as the routing engine for the contact center application platformTwilio Flex(link takes you to an external page), which can handle thousands of agents in one instance, because of its powerful ability to dynamically filter workers, optimize and prioritize tasks, and strategize for workers taking tasks on multiple channels concurrently.

A user can ask a chatbot a question (What's the weather today?) or make a command (Play Rick Astley), and the chatbot responds or performs the action. | Early versions of chatbots included the iconicELIZA(link takes you to an external page)program (1966) which simulated a psychotherapist, andPARRY(link takes you to an external page)(1972), meant to mimic a person with paranoid schizophrenia. Both of these chatbot programs simulated typed conversations. | Now, many chatbots include voice interaction that leveragenatural language processing (NLP)and Natural Language Understanding (NLU. This gives them complex functional features, like the ability to carry out a task or gather information for a user. | Modern chatbots are often used where short interactions and limited responses are required. They play a significant role in customer service and marketing applications. A chatbot can answer questions about products, services, or policies. If a customer needs to do more than the chatbot can handle, the program can escalate to hand off the interaction to a human operator. | Modern chatbots are also often used online and in messaging apps. They are also included in operating systems as virtual intelligence assistants (e.g., Apple's Siri and Windows' Cortana). Chatbot appliances like Alexa and Google Home are also growing in prevalence and can perform a myriad of functions based on user commands. | Chatbots may function in two main ways, depending on if they are built on aset of rulesormachine learning. | A chatbot based on a set of rules is quite limited. It can only respond to a limited set of precise commands. If a chatbot is programmed to tell you the time or the weather, it will not be able to respond to a request like \"Which artist wrote 'Never Gonna Give You Up?'\" These chatbots are oftenstateless, meaning that they approach each interaction as if it were with a new user. These bots have no active memory of prior communication. | A chatbot that functions usingmachine learningis built on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including natural language processing, deep learning, and machine learning algorithms. These complex chatbots understand language, not just specific commands. | AI powered chatbots require a massive amount of data and arestateful, meaning that they can review past interactions and include that context in its responses. The more stateful a bot interacts with its users, the better the bot gets at recognizing human speech and predicting the appropriate response or action to take. | Some examples of chatbots you might interact with on a daily basis are virtual assistants like Google Assistant & Amazon's Alexa. Messaging apps like Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp also often leverage chatbots for businesses to better communicate with their customers. | While bots appear vastly different, they fall into two main categories: transactional (stateless)or conversational (stateful). | The time savings and efficiency gained from AI chatbots and conversational assistants help companies increase their customer service productivity or sales. By leveraging chatbots, human agents are freed up to focus on high profile customer service or sales rather than spending all day answering questions about a business' return policy. | Chatbots also help improve the customer experience. Many businesses have leveraged phone trees for decades, which work but are time consuming for the customer to navigate. A chatbot can turn \"Press 1 for Alex, press 2 for Joey\" into \"Who can I connect you with?\" The chatbot can understand the caller's input if they say \"Joey\" and route the call directly. | Today, people are using messenger apps more than they use telephones or social networks. Providing chatbots on these messaging platforms opens up large markets to a business. | Interested in learning more about chatbots, or even building one yourself?

            "What is Click to Call?",
            "Click to call, sometimes calledclick to talkorclick to dial, is a way to let people connect with a company representative by phone while they're browsing a website or in an app. | Your website or app may be full of useful information, but sometimes, your customers really just want to talk with a real, live person. Perhaps they want to know more about your product or service before they make the decision to buy, or maybe they have a support issue and don't want to wait around for email. Click to call creates a way for your customers to contact your sales and support teams right on your website. | You may be wondering, \"Do people really talk on the phone anymore?\" The answer is, actually, yes! | Studies have shown that88% of website visitors(link takes you to an external page)are more likely to contact your company if you provide a click to call button. And if they've taken the initiative totalkto you, chances are greatly increased they'llbuyfrom you too. | The numbers really do speak for themselves.Market research(link takes you to an external page)shows adding a click to call button can lead to a 200% increase in call to conversion rates. In addition to helping you increase sales and improve customer satisfaction, adding click to call functionality can help reduce negative impressions as well. | One way businesses can add a click to call system is through anAPI(link takes you to an external page)like Twilio Voice. Twilio works with browsers built with JavaScript, Android, and iOS. Add on features likeTaskRouterlet you route calls to the best agent to provide an even better customer experience. There are two main ways click to call can work. | With one click, the user initiates a voice call directly from their browser or app. For example,Airbnb(link takes you to an external page)createdVoice Connect(link takes you to an external page), a click to call application that lets hosts call potential guests by clicking a link on Airbnb's site or within the Airbnb app. With Voice Connect, hosts and guests connect usingmasked numbers, which allows them to keep their personal phone numbers private. Click to call usesVoIPso the call connects over the internet rather than by phone. | A button, image, or text on the site or app lets the user enters a phone number and requests an immediate call back. While the call is being established, contextual information about the customer\u2014such as their name, the page they're currently visiting, and any other relevant information the API can access\u2014is passed to the representative on the call. The customer doesn't have to actually enter this information, the service knows it automatically. An HTTP request initiated by the web form initiates an outbound call to the user's phone number and the user gets their callback right away. This process allows users to receive highly personalized customer service, with the click of a button. | Many companies choose to offer their customers both text chat and phone connection options, and find that the customer's device type affects their choice of channel. For example, Twilio customeriAdvise finds that 70%(link takes you to an external page)of their customers opt for text chat when connecting to their site on desktop, while 30% choose voice calls. However, when customers are on mobile devices the percentages are reversed, with 70% of users selecting click to call to connect via voice and 30% choosing text chat. | Another way that businesses use click to call is for sales and support agents working in a CRM. Twilio offers an integrated dialer that lets reps automatically place outbound calls with just one click. For example, withLightning Dialer in Salesforce(link takes you to an external page), one click calls a customer and opens their entire contextual record. Reps can take notes seamlessly, automatically log calls, drop pre recorded voicemails, power through call lists, and more. This ability to \"click\" the phone number without manually entering it saves time, reduces errors, and increases agent efficiency. | Adding click to call to your website with a Twilio SDK is fast and can be accomplished in a matter of minutes. It's also affordable, with callsstarting very cheaply per minute(link takes you to an external page). And you always pay only for what you use\u2014no monthly fees or sign up costs. | Ready to get started?Add Click to Call to your website here |  | "

A company's contact center is usually integrated with their customer relationship management (CRM) system, where all interactions between the organization and the public are tracked, coordinated, and managed. | The termcontact centeris replacing the older term \"call center\" to reflect the modern reality that there are many other ways to connect with a customer these days besides the telephone. The International Customer Management Institute (ICMI) defines a contact center as a coordinated system of people, processes, technologies, and strategies that provides access to information, resources and expertise, through appropriate channels of communication, enabling interactions that create value for the customer and organization. | The combined trends of increased customer expectations and newer technologies that allow formany channels of communication(link takes you to an external page)are creating a shift in the traditional call center model which has existed for decades. Consumers want more ways to reach businesses, and businesses are looking for new ways to improve customer experience. | Contact centers support a number of different industries and functions, and often handle contacts via channels beyond the telephone, including email, chat, social media, and SMS. Contact centers deploy technological solutions and operational processes to distribute contacts to teams of contact center agents, often located in one or more locations. | In a modernmultichannel or omnichannel(link takes you to an external page)contact center, agents handle a wide variety of communications. For example, technical support might be delivered overin app chat(link takes you to an external page)or video, while order status updates are delivered viaSMS(link takes you to an external page), event promotions are sent aspush notifications, surveys are deployed overFacebook Messenger, and inbound email sales inquiries are sent directly to an agent to connect by phone. | Multichannelrefers to a contact center that uses multiple independent channels to reach a customer, such as telephone, social media, and email. Whereasomnichannelis an extension of the multichannel approach, emphasizing the synergies across all channels for an enhanced shopping and customer care experience. For example, a customer can browse a furniture company's website, live chat with an agent to ask questions about a particular couch, switch seamlessly to a video call to confirm that the couch will fit in a specific space, purchase the couch online, and then pick it up at a brick and mortar location. | Contact centers can handle inbound communications\u2014such as incoming calls, emails, chats, social media, or SMS inquiries that are initiated by customers and prospects. And they can also be the hub for outbound communications\u2014contacts made by contact center agents to reach customers and prospects, such as calls, emails, and chats. | Legacy,on premise contact centerslet businesses customize the experience they want to deliver but require costly professional services and take months (or years!) to deploy changes. | Many of these systems are running on outdated technology and infrastructure. This underlying technology impacts systems reliability, performance, and security, which is why so many businesses are migrating to a modern alternative. | When you build your contact center with communication building blocks like Twilio's programmable APIs, you can choose the channels and features you need and add more as your call center expands into multiple channels. APIs give you the flexibility to build the exact customer experience you want, and the freedom to iterate yourIVR, call flows, and other aspects of your communications as frequently as you like. | If you don't want to build your own software with APIs, you can use software that already exists through a Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) provider. CCaaS providers host the software, maintaining the servers, databases, and code. Customers access it via the internet and pay for their use on a subscription or pay as you go basis. Many CCaaS offerings are built on Twilio APIs. They've taken written and tested logic, and packaged it together usingcontact center best practices(link takes you to an external page)for SMBs. | However, as many of the small and medium size enterprises using these CCaaS solutions grow, they find that their software isn't flexible enough to adapt to their changing customer and business needs. With the introduction of the programmable contact center platform, technology has evolved to offer businesses the best of both worlds. Platforms likeTwilio Flex(link takes you to an external page)enable companies to build at unprecedented speed while customizing a unique design for their specific customer and business requirements. Although Twilio Flex is more intuitive than building with APIs, it's still an open platform meant for custom software development rather than a completely out of the box solution. | See alsoWhat is a Cloud Contact Center?? |  | "

            "What is a CSAT Score?",
            "Short forCustomer Satisfaction Score, CSAT is a measurement to determine whether a customer feels their expectations have been fulfilled by a company's products and services. | A company's average CSAT score reflects the percentage of customers who are satisfied with the company's products or services. It is expressed as a percentage with 100 percent representing complete customer satisfaction. | Across industries and around the world, businesses knowhappy customers come back for more. A study published in theHarvard Business Review(link takes you to an external page)found customers who gave their experiences the highest ratings spent 140% more than customers who gave their experiences the lowest ratings. | CSAT scores are an important metric for every business. Satisfied customers buy more, stay longer, and share their positive experiences with others. In fact, after a positive communications experience,7 out of 10 consumers(link takes you to an external page)will recommend the business to their friends or purchase more products or services. However, most businessesoverestimatehow effective they are at delivering a positive communication experience. | This lack of awareness can have devastating effects for businesses. | Twilio'sCustomer Communications Report(link takes you to an external page)found that after a poor communication experience, 38% of customers will switch to a competitor or cancel orders or services, 66% will tell a friend about their experience, and 41% will stop doing business with a company altogether. And91%(link takes you to an external page)of those dissatisfied customers will give the company zero warning before they take their business elsewhere. | These stats go to show that to truly understand how satisfied your customers are, you need to ask them. When you're doing business face to face, customer satisfaction comes across in a smile, a generous tip, or of course, repeat business. But when your customers are mostly interacting with your business online, it can be harder to gauge how happy they are. If you want to estimate whether they'll be back for more, you often need to ask them with a customer satisfaction survey. | Ultimately, customer satisfaction is a measurement of customer perception and expectations. When an interaction exceeds customer expectations, the experience is positive. When an interaction fails to meet customer expectations, the experience is negative. Customer satisfaction surveys help you begin to understand your customer experience. You can learn how your customers really feel about the service they've just experienced by conducting post contact surveys via channels likeSMS(link takes you to an external page),email(link takes you to an external page),IVR, or a star rating after aweb chat(link takes you to an external page). | When you gather customer feedback, you can look at the metrics that make sense for your company and change what isn't working. The only way to provide ongoing customer satisfaction is to stay informed about your customers' expectations and perceptions. |  | "

            "DTMF, orDual Tone Multi Frequencytones, are in band telecommunications signals sent over voice frequencies. Commonly used over telephone lines, DTMF tones are also commonly calledTouch Tones. | Almost as long as we've had telegraph and telephony systems, humans have needed a way to reliably interact with the system in a mechanical and reproducible way. Signalling systems have evolved to fill that role both for routing and dialing calls as well as for interacting with phone systems once connected. | The first commonly used telephony signaling system waspulse dialing. Rotary phones interrupt electrical connections while spinning, and the resulting electrical pulses produced are interpreted as commands (such as 'dial this number'). | The first DTMF tone producing telephone was introduced inNovember of 1963(link takes you to an external page)for the Bell System. More user friendly than the rotation of a rotary dial, touch tone phones quickly supplanted the rotary phone. Dialing speed increased, stress on the network decreased, and users flocked to the new technology. | DTMF tones today are standardized in the International Telecommunication Union's (ITU T)Recommendation Q.23(link takes you to an external page). | Nowadays, DTMF tones are the dominant signalling protocol for interacting with the telephone system or with automated telephone services. IVRs, orInteractive Voice Responsesystems allow callers to navigate without tying up an operator. Many other use cases for DTMF tones have also emerged from booking appointments to checking bank balances to changing language on a phone call. | DTMF tones are an example of anin band signaling protocol; that is, signals are sent over the same communications channel as the primary data on that channel. For DTMF tones that means that tones are in the same frequency range as human voice any DTMF tones produced can be heard over the line. | Out of Band signaling protocolstake an opposite tack signals are sent over a separate channel. Commonly used telecommunications protocols such as Signaling System No. 6 (SS6) and Signaling System No. 7 (SS7) use an out of band channel for signaling and switching purposes. | Although out of band signaling systems aren't immune from abuse, when in band signaling protocols were dominant (especially for switching and routing) they were an order of magnitude easier to exploit. This manifested in the so called 'Phreaking' subculture, wherein knowledgeable people could exploit tones and tone order to gain access to phone features or avoid charges. One infamous in band signaling exploit (no longer viable) was on the2600 Hz tone(link takes you to an external page), which denoted an idling phone trunk. | While in band signals shouldn't be used to control mission critical infrastructure, they are still very useful for telephone users. Audible feedback in the same channel gives the user some indication they properly entered a command. While building a telephony application, DTMF tones are an excellent way to add user directed interaction. | All digits sent are encoded using RFC 2833. | Ready to start building out anapp that uses DTMF tonesto navigate? We've got you covered in all of our supported languages. | Whatever your use case,Twilio's Programmable Voice(link takes you to an external page)can help you achieve success.

APIs allow the provisioning and configuration of numbers on the fly and make it easier to retrieve data into actionable dashboards. This in turn allows marketers to direct advertising spend to the channels that move the needle and cut it from those that don't. | Dynamic Number Insertion basically means tying unique phone numbers to each advertisement (or type of advertisement) you want to track. | For instance, let's say you want to know which provides a higher ROI: your billboard ads or your late night TV spot.

Any subsequent calls to that number can be attributed to that ad. This works well if you have a few lead sources that never change. Most marketers today are operating at a larger scale with hundreds of different lead sources, meaning they have to allocate phone numbers in large numbers which is costly. | Dynamic number insertion allows marketers to recycle numbers not in use to reduce total usage volume.Phone Number APIsare flexible enough to accommodate recycling strategies for any business.

Usually delivered through SMS messages or voice calls, ETA alerts keep customers updated on the location and timing of their upcoming deliveries. | Applications with ETA alerts have exploded in popularity during the surge of the on demand economy. Companies promising quick food, laundry, and shopping delivery (and more) have seized on the intimacy and deliverability of text messaging to create a constant flow of interaction with their customers. Customers appreciate the effort, and now ETA Alerts have evolved into a major business priority in many fields. Common practices include notifications when an item is picked up or a driver leaves, one or more updates along the way, and a final update as the driver arrives at the destination. | Having an ETA Alert system in place also confers other unexpected benefits as well especially along the lines of delivery exceptions. Accidents, breakdowns, routing delays, and other exceptions previously confused customers. Communicating problems by pushing out batch emails at the end of the day or (worse!) sending customers to arcane status pages further compounded customer frustration. | With constant contact, customer schedules are less disrupted than with the previous \"X Hour Window\" paradigm.

This includes a person's name, driver's license number, location data, IP address, biometric data, and more. | Processingis a broad term that encompasses nearly any use of personal data, including collection, storage, organization, alteration, destruction, and transmission. For all intents and purposes, any use of personal data is considered processing. | Under the GDPR, an organization processing personal data acts as either acontrolleror aprocessor. A controller determines the purpose for processing the data. Whether the controller processes the data itself or contracts another party to do the processing, the controller decides how the data are used. A processor processes data only on behalf of the controller. The sole objective of the processor is to process the data for the controller. | For example, imagine a law office that conducts virtual office consultations usingTwilio Video(link takes you to an external page). The video calls could contain many pieces of personal information shared between the clients and attorneys. With regard to all the data shared during the consultations, the law practice is the controller, and Twilio is the processor. The law office determines how to use the clients' information. However, Twilio manages the transmission of the data. The law practicecontrolsthe personal data by determining a specific use for the data. Twilio handles theprocessingby providing the technical infrastructure to facilitate the video call. | Many organizations are both controllers and processors. For example, Twilio is a processor on behalf of its customers' content, but it is also a controller with respect to the data it processes for its own business needs\u2014like billing, marketing, and HR functions. | In order to be GDPR compliant, an organization cannot collect more data than it needs to achieve a specific lawful purpose.

If something does go wrong, and there's a data breach that creates a risk to the privacy rights of individuals, the organization has to notify its supervisory authority of that breach within 72 hours of becoming aware of it. | There are some exceptions to these rules, and this text is not meant to be comprehensive. Complete information is available inChapter IV(link takes you to an external page)of the GDPR legal text. | As an individual, you have the right to be informed about how your data will be processed and for what purpose.

Notably, this means that data delivery isbest effort; latency and deliverability will vary at times. Quality of Service (QoS) with GPRS varies because it depends on the number of other users sharing the service. | Before GPRS, there were two commonly used protocols for data transfer:Circuit Switched Data(link takes you to an external page)(CSD) and High Speed Circuit Switched Data (HSCSD). While an improvement over previous data solutions (such as cellular modems), they worked in much the same manner as phone calls and were billed similarly by time. | GPRS was an improvement in efficiency and a feature boon for customers as well. Instead of the transmission schemes used in CSD, GPRS uses Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) over shared channels to transmit data.

            "GSM 7 is a character encoding standard which packs the most commonly used letters and symbols in many languages into 7 bits each for usage on GSM networks. As SMS messages are transmitted 140 8 bit octets at a time, GSM 7 encoded SMS messages can carry up to 160 characters. | GSM 7 is the standard alphabet forSMSmessages, written up in the standardGSM 03.38(link takes you to an external page). It is always supported onGSM(link takes you to an external page)networks. In languages with more than 128 commonly used symbols, GSM 7 is mandated. However, local language support is implemented with shift tables or by changing text encoding to (16 bit)UCS 2encoding. | The basic character set for GSM 7can be found here(link takes you to an external page). | For some characters, such as '{' and ']', an escape code is required so even in a GSM 7 encoded message these characters will be encoded using two characters. | SMS messages contain 140 8 bit octets, so up to 160 GSM 7 characters may be transmitted: (140*8)/7 = 160. | When sending SMS messages with Twilio, we'll automatically send messages in the most compact encoding possible. If you includeanynon GSM 7 characters in your message body, we will automatically fall back toUCS 2encoding (which will limit message bodies to 70 characters each). | Additionally, for long messages  greater than 160 GSM 7 characters or 70 UCS 2 characters  Twilio will split the message into multiple segments. Twilio also prepends aUser Data Header(link takes you to an external page)of six (6) Bytes to instruct the receiving device on how to re assemble messages. For multi segment messages, this leaves153 GSM 7 charactersor67 UCS 2 charactersper segment. | Note that this may cause more message segments to be sent than you expect a body with 152 GSM 7 compatible characters and a single unicode character will be split into three (3) messages because the unicode character changes the encoding into less compact UCS 2. This will incur charges for three outgoing messages against your account. | This page(link takes you to an external page)contains an interactive tool which can check if encoding your message in GSM 7 is possible, or if UCS 2 is needed. | Unfortunately, GSM 7 is not a supported character encoding in many text editors. Even setting encoding to ASCII (or US_ASCII, or UTF 8) will not guarantee that text you write will be limited to GSM 7. You can use the above linked tool to quickly check the number of segments that is, total messages some text will be divided into. | If you are writing in an editor with Unicode support you'll need to be particularly careful. Text editors designed for writing might automatically add angled smart quotes, non standard spaces, or punctuation which looks similar to GSM 7 but is a different Unicode character.

            "Interactive voice response (IVR), also known as a phone tree, provides an automated telephony system for callers using voice and touch tones (DTMF). | Customers don't like to wait in an age of lightning fast connectivity. Incoming calls flood today's organizations with customers who want their questions answered pronto. | Interactive voice response (IVR)(link takes you to an external page)is an automated telephony system that helps companies handle inbound calls efficiently. In its basic form, IVR\u2014also known as an interactive voice recording or interactive voice recorder\u2014uses voice recognition and touch tone keypad selections to steer callers through menu options and information. | Also called a phone tree, IVR works with automatic call distribution (ACD) to route inbound calls to the best departments and agents for customer inquiries. IVR also gives callers information and helps them complete tasks without ever speaking to a human representative. This frees agents to handle more complex customer concerns, shortens hold times, and eliminates extra hiring. | Learn how to build a self service IVR system that wows your customers.Contact Twilio for support(link takes you to an external page). | IVR saves companies time and money by speeding up calls and requiring fewer agents to handle customer inquiries. The main features that allow IVR to process requests include dual tone multi frequency (DTMF) signaling and voice recognition. | DTMF signaling occurs when callers select menu options using their keypad. They \"press 1 to make an appointment, 2 for billing,\" and so on. In other words, this technology routes callers to the departments and specialists most likely to address their needs\u2014reducing hold times. But some callers get impatient with inefficiently designed menu options. | That's why more advanced IVR incorporates increasingly sophisticated voice recognition technology to help customers handle tasks on their own. The most cutting edge technology is natural language processing (NLP), which can understand full sentences instead of key presses or short commands. When done well, NLP resolves customers' questions quickly and makes calls more enjoyable, improving their impression of the business. | From a caller's perspective, IVR is a common phone menu that prompts them to press touch tone keys that emitDTMF tonesor say words that speech recognition detects. | Here's a breakdown of the process: | Once upon a time, IVR relied on many expensive components to function: | Today, cloud contact center solutions like Twilio'sProgrammable Voice API(link takes you to an external page)come integrated with IVR, combining decoded DTMF tones and web application logic to help you build your call center's menu in a snap.OurVoice API(link takes you to an external page)builds custom IVR systems without specialized hardware.

The technology enables intelligent, segmented call routing for a richer context and a faster resolution, which90% of consumers(link takes you to an external page)rate as important or very important when it comes to handling a customer support issue. | Moreover, IVR systems also supply general and account specific information to callers, freeing representatives to handle more complex inquiries\u2014automated IVR systems are especially beneficial for organizations with high call volume. Plus, customers can find quick answers to questions and perform basic tasks themselves, such as paying bills, making reservations, and tracking orders. | Helping customers help themselves can reduce transfers and prevent delays, paving the way to customer satisfaction. When your IVR software is up to date and runs smoothly, customers are less likely to get frustrated and demand to speak to an agent. In other words, better experiences benefit your call center as a whole and increase profitability. | Contrary to popular belief, IVR is no longer reserved for large corporations or enterprises with big call centers.

            "Jitteris the variation in periodicity of a signal or periodic event from its target or true frequency. In telecommunications, jitter further refers to the variation in latency of packets carrying voice or video data over a communications channel. | Telecommunications traffic nowadays often travels across apacket switched network and quite often on the public internet. For participants in a session, voice or video data is converted into packets and routed 'towards' a recipient. Packet switched networks make no guarantee that all packets will take the same route to the destination. They are forwarded based on the current network status (and various algorithms) based upon the destination in the packet header and potentially the type of traffic. | Because of the lack of promises, packets traveling a fixed physical distance can take longer or shorter to arrive or even arrive out of order. The variation in arrival times (latency) is thejitter. | There are many potential causes of jitter on a network. However, variation in routing and forwarding packets causes the majority of issues. Cache sizes and configuration differences in intermediate forwarding nodes can change routes, but most commonly network congestion causes routes to change and latency to vary. | In the above image,packet 1makes six hops whilepacket 2only needs to make two. This might be the difference between 10 ms and 40 ms of latency and might meanpacket 2actually arrives beforepacket 1. If a call continues to split between the two possible routes, latency will average 25 milliseconds, but the average instantaneous latency difference between packets taking the opposite route will be 30 ms. | Jitter is an overloaded term;RFC 3393(link takes you to an external page)labels the +/ 30 ms measurement asIP Packet Delay Variation. Another common measurement of jitter is to use thevariance(link takes you to an external page)of packet latencies if they are expected or known to be randomly distributed (not bifurcated as in our example). | Small amounts of jitter can be counteracted with thejitter buffer. The jitter buffer queues incoming packets on the receiver side and can reorder or smooth incoming packets before releasing them to the user. Buffer length is generally a user setting; note that buffer length trades off with increasing latency. Setting too large a buffer directly increases the latency of actions on the sender side being received by a user. | Routers and operating systems queue outgoing packets in a buffer before releasing them to a wider network. A poorly set buffer size in your operating system or on network equipment can cause a condition known asbufferbloat, whereexcess packet queueing(link takes you to an external page)introduces irrecoverable jitter. | Quality of Service (QoS) routing settings on your network equipment can also factor into higher jitter. Prioritizing voice and video traffic can work around buffering problems. If you've tried other optimizations, QoS settings are the next place to look. | Twilio can provideSIP Trunking(link takes you to an external page)services with our ownprivate connections(link takes you to an external page)and routing choices, potentially greatly increasing the reliability of routes from source to destination and back.

            "Large Language Models or LLMs are a form ofArtificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Generative AI. An LLM is a model that was trained on a large amount of text and can generate new text.\nAn LLM generates new text by taking an input text (typically called \"prompt\") and predicting what words come next. The result are models that can generate human like content and some have even displayed reasoning capabilities to work through complex problems.\nThis is the reason why for many, LLMs are an important step towards a world ofautonomous agentsandArtificial General Intelligence (AGI)(link takes you to an external page) | Some of the most famous LLMs areOpenAI's GPT models(link takes you to an external page),Google's Gemini models(link takes you to an external page),Anthropic's Claude models(link takes you to an external page)and open source models such asMeta's Llama models(link takes you to an external page)andMistral's Mistral & Mixtral models(link takes you to an external page) | Since LLMs are great at generating and processing human like text, they are incredibly well suited for communication use cases. You can use them directly to generate content for the messages you plan to send, perform analysis on your communications by parsing through call transcripts or leveraging built in Twilio capabilities such asVoice Intelligence's Natural Language Operators(link takes you to an external page). | Increasingly LLMs are also becoming multi modal, meaning additionally to processing and responding to text they can process audio, video, and images. This opens up further communication use cases such as using an LLM to answer questions about images that were sent via MMS or WhatsApp. | As much as LLMs are incredibly powerful, there are some real considerations to make when using LLMs or products that use LLMs. The three most common considerations are around privacy, hallucinations, and manipulation. | Once an LLM was trained, it does not magically learn new information but is essentially frozen in time. However, some AI systems might choose to collect the data sent to the model to perform additional training later to improve the accuracy of the LLM. This process is typically called \"fine tuning\" and can be done through a variety of different techniques. | The important part regardless of whether an LLM gets initially trained or fine tuned later on, it's important to understand how data is going to be used in this training process. Since LLMs use probabilities to generate their output, there is always a chance that the training data can surface in responses from the LLM. | At Twilio we useAI Nutrition Labels(link takes you to an external page)to make it clear to customers if and how we use data to further train the models we use, as well as which LLM we used as the base. | Since LLMs use probabilities based on the data they were trained on to generate their responses, LLMs will always try to respond with information. While this is the thing that makes LLMs intriguing in the first place, it can at times result in the LLM returning non factual responses that are referred to as \"hallucinations\". | While there are mitigations to reduce the risk of hallucinations, such as leveragingretrieval augmented generation (RAG), using fine tuning, or using additional LLMs to \"validate\" the output, there is always a risk of an LLM hallucinating some content. | The nature of how LLMs are architected makes them prone to manipulation. While the types of attacks have different names such as \"prompt injection\", \"prompt leakage\" or \"jailbreaks\" they all aim at coercing the LLM to do something it isn't supposed to do.This might be coercing it to reveal the prompt instructions it received to perform a task (\"prompt leakage\"), injecting content that modifies the behavior outlined in the original \"prompt\" (\"prompt injection\") or to break out of the safety mechanisms in the model (\"jailbreaks\"). | Because of the risk of manipulation it's important to consider safety mechanisms not just within the LLM (by modifying your prompt) but also outside of your LLM through additional input screening, strong permissioning (if you let LLMs decide to perform tasks) and generally not considering your prompts as \"private\" if the remaining input is untrusted. |  | "

            "Latency is the time delay between the initiation of an event and its perception by some observer. In networking and telecommunications, latency is the time between a sender causing a change in a system's state and its reception by an observer. Network latency is often informally used interchangeably withlag. | Excess latency is one of the most common causes of poor Voice or Video communications quality over a network. As networked communications emulate face to face or verbal communications, long delays between transmission and reception of a signal are noticeable and off putting. High latency, especially without prepared participants, causes communications breakdowns and stops conversation flow. | Latency's effects depend on observers, but most will perceive latency around 100 120 milliseconds. Communications will start to break down around 250 300ms. If all parties are aware of large latency in a session (e.g. if all parties know a call is over a satellite connection), this delay might still be acceptable. | The International Telecommunications Union has codified recommendations onmaximum acceptable one way latencyinITU T G.114(link takes you to an external page). Their recommendation for network planning is to keep one way latencybelow 400msat the absolute low end while noting that atarget of 150ms one way latencyis suitable for most purposes. Some applications, especially those with interactive sessions, will be best experienced with latencies under 100ms. | For many applications of IP communications, the largest contributor to latency is the routing between the sender and receiver. This is caused by the physical routes the packets are forwarded over, as well as the individualized caches, settings, and congestion on intermediate forwarding nodes. | A partial list of other contributors to latency (but by no means an exhaustive one) follows: | Latency measurement was standardized in IETF'sRFC 2544(link takes you to an external page), based on definitions of latency fromRFC 1242(link takes you to an external page). RFC 1242 draws a distinction between store and forward devices and bit forwarding devices, but latency measures from when the last of the data leaves an output to when the first of the data reaches the input. Generally, in IP applications, latency measures the time between when the last piece of data leaves a sender to when the recipient receives the first piece of data. | pingis a utility which sends ICMPECHOpackets to measure network performance. In itsmost commonly used implementation(link takes you to an external page), ping will sendECHOpackets and receiveECHO REPLYpackets. Ping then rolls up results to calculate statistics related to round trip times. | Although closely related to latency (especially when routing or network latency dominates), ping is slightly different. On top of taking two trips through the network, there is also some compute time involved for the recipient to receive and process theECHOpacket and to send anECHO REPLY. However, ping often gives an excellent estimate of latency and can be used to diagnose or identify many latency issues. | In many cases, network effects cause the largest increase in latency. Although physical distance matters, the actual routes taken by packets in a session may be much longer. Take, for instance, the following example: | Two participants are both on the equator, 1,000 miles apart in a straight line.Their communications path is through a satellite in Geosynchronous (more accuratelyGeostationary(link takes you to an external page)) Orbit exactly bisecting the two, 22,236 miles above earth. Rounding off, the path from A or B to the Satellite is 22,273 miles.It takes light about 119.6 ms to travel that distance, so if the satellite takes 2 ms to process packets, the minimum one way latency added by the route is241.2 milliseconds! | Compare a satellite route with a wired connection around the curve of the earth, which would be around 1,003 miles long at a minimum. | Routing paths can cause a significant increase in latency, as seen in this example. The effect of this latency is often seen in television interviews and talks given via satellite; there is a noticeable delay between parties talking. | While Twilio can't help decrease the physical distance between the participants in your IP Video or Voice communications, we can assist with avoidable routing delays and help you monitor your session quality. | Ourlow latency Voice Conference Product(link takes you to an external page)has a global low latency routing architecture, helping improve the routing between intermediate nodes in your calls.

Robust live chat systems include typing indicators, chat history, read receipts, and integration into third party software (e.g. ticketing support issues, collecting and analyzing data, or routing customers to the most appropriate representative), all of which improve the chat experience for both the agent and the customer. While we often think of live chat as a tool for websites, it is also widespread in mobile applications. | One of the most dynamic ways to connect with users, live chat is now an integral part of many companies' customer support process. Live chat is faster than email and is far more efficient than phone support. An experienced customer service representative can field multiple chat instances at a time. Incorporating automated greetings and responses both decreases the amount of work repetitive work a CS agent has to do and provides instant contact for the user who needs help. | Web and mobile users have adapted quickly to live chat for their support needs. Live chat gives customers instant access to support, with nothing to download and no need to leave the website to make a call or send an email. Live chat offers shorter wait times, and customers can multitask while waiting, which eases the pain of waiting for answers.

            "A Microprocessor is an integrated circuit whose function is almost infinitely changeable through programming. | In the 1950s and 1960s, computers were large. Mainframe machines filled entire rooms. Minicomputers were smaller but still chunky, though there were a few desktop models. All of them were constructed out of function specific modules \u2014 units for performing arithmetic and logic tasks, memory managers, input/output controllers, for example \u2014 each of which was constructed out of integrated circuits (the first \"silicon chips\") and discrete components. | The first commercial Microprocessor, Intel's 4004, launched in November 1971. It was a single integrated circuit like those used in computer modules but of far greater complexity. It compressed a mainframe or mini's entire Central Processing Unit onto a tiny sliver of silicon. It required separate memory, IO and program storage chips, but it was architecturally no different from the 'big iron' running company payrolls, handling airline bookings, logging data in labs, or monitoring nations' defences. | The Microprocessor would come to dominate computing. Today, all computers, from the largest super computer to the smallest Internet of Things (IoT) device, derive their computing capacity from Microprocessors. | The irony is that Microprocessors were never intended to be used in computers. The first Microprocessors, developed simultaneously by Intel and Texas Instruments, were attempts to simplify application specific chipsets by replacing fixed function components with programmable ones. \"How can I replace dozens of chips with just a handful?\" these two companies were asked by their clients. The solution: create a general purpose platform that could be programmed to deliver any desired application's functionality. | It was amateur computing buffs who latched onto the Microprocessor as the basis for cheap computers. Enthusiasts in the US, the UK, and other countries couldn't afford minicomputers, even small ones, so they had to build their own. Some parts were taken from machines discarded by businesses and institutions. Other modules were hand assembled. But the new Microprocessor technology allowed these folks to construct computers with much fewer parts and much more cheaply. | That's why Steve Wozniak built the Apple I. It was his personal hobby machine \u2014 until Steve Jobs realized it could be sold to enthusiasts who lacked Woz' electronics skills. MITS' Altair kit, featured on the January 1975 cover ofPopular Electronicsmagazine, was their inspiration, as it was for other 'micro' pioneers. In the UK, John Miller Kirkpatrick, Tim Moore, Chris Shelton, and Mike Fischer designed machines they or their clients would commercialize. | That was in the mid 1970s. Within a couple of years, on both sides of the Atlantic, enthusiasts were becoming entrepreneurs and offering their designs as commercials systems, first as single board computers \u2014 naked but complete circuit boards \u2014 then as packaged computers with integrated keyboards. Then came the killer applications, then the graphical user interface (GUI), then the OS wars \u2014 Windows vs Mac OS. By the 1990s, all personal computing was done on microprocessor based systems. Many of PCs in use in business were linked over networks to microprocessor based servers. Out went the minicomputer. The servers were soon connected to other servers, and data centers ditched mainframes for racks of microprocessor filled units. Today, the entire Internet runs off them, even the routers that manage the massive flow of data around the global network. Mainframes are museum pieces. | Today there are billions, possible trillions, of microprocessors in use all over the world, in almost every electronic device. The Microprocessor has achieved this is its first 50 years. What will the next 50 years hold for this truly revolutionary technology? |  | "

It spans hundreds of dialects, each with a set of grammar rules, syntax, terms, and slang. | Although we don't consciously engage in natural language processing, our minds subconsciously dissect spoken phrases into parts, much like how we learned to diagram sentences in middle school. Similarly, computer systems tag various elements of speech, detect the language spoken or written, and identify semantic relationships between words. | NLP technology allows computers to communicate with humans by pulling meaningful data from text or speech prompts. Because computers can scale language related tasks, it enables them to read and interpret text or speech and determine what to do with the information. This framework is the foundation for most automation software programs we use today. | Additionally, NLP resolves ambiguity in language by adding numeric structure to large data sets, which makes text analytics andspeech recognition technology(link takes you to an external page)possible. | Computers understand and process human language through techniques ranging from NLP machine learning methods toadvanced language models like ChatGPT(link takes you to an external page), which use large quantities of data to create probable responses to user inputs. | NLP technology generally follows 3 steps: | You can learn more aboutthe steps to NLP(link takes you to an external page)to discover the vast amounts of natural language data available, improve customer engagement and satisfaction, and automate or optimize business processes. | Homonyms\u2014words that are spelled and sounding the same but have different meanings\u2014create an intricate problem for computers.

That ultimate question is the single most important item Reichheld suggested including on a customer survey: | \"On a zero to ten scale, how likely is it that you would recommend our product, service, or brand to a friend or colleague?\" | He suggested following with the qualifier, \"What is the primary reason for your score?\" and leaving it open for customers to complete in their own words. | Reichheld called customer satisfaction surveys \"long and complicated, yielding low response rates and ambiguous implications that are difficult for operating managers to act on.\" In contrast, Reichheld claimed that NPS survey responses are the most reliable indicator of a company's ability to grow,regardlessof industry. | \"By substituting a single question for the complex black box of the typical customer satisfaction survey, companies can actually put consumer survey results to use and focus employees on the task of stimulating growth.\" Frederick F. Reichheld, Harvard Business Review | Customer satisfaction (CSAT) surveys are commonly sent to customers shortly after an interaction with a company. These can help you understand how your customers really feel about the service they've just experienced and show you if you're meeting their expectations. These post contact surveys are usually conducted via channels likeSMS(link takes you to an external page), email, or a star rating after aweb chat(link takes you to an external page). The results yield what is known as a company'scustomer satisfaction score,the percentage of customers who are satisfied with the service they receive. | While CSAT surveys can give you a measurement of short term happiness regarding yourcustomer experience, they may not tell you what Reichheld says you really need to know:will your customers be back for more? | In contrast, an NPS survey asks customers about their satisfaction in a different way. Rather than focusing on a recent experience, NPS surveys look to the future by asking how likely customers are to recommend your company. If they're likely to recommend you, they're likely to remain loyal themselves. | You can deploy NPS surveys viaSMS(link takes you to an external page), email,IVR, in appchat(link takes you to an external page),Facebook Messenger, or any othercommunication channel. | Following the question, \"On a zero to ten scale, how likely is it that you would recommend our product, service, or brand to a friend or colleague?\" The customer is presented with a rating scale of0 10. | Customer responses are categorized into three groups: | Detractors:customers who gave a score of 0 to 6 aredissatisfiedwith your company. These customers are considered more likely to discourage friends or colleagues from using your product and services than to recommend you. Detractors are at risk of switching to a competitor and encouraging others to do the same. | Passives:customers who gave a score of either 7 or 8 areneutraland indicating that they probably won't be recommending your company to others any time soon. They might not be unhappy, but they aren't happy enough to promote your company. Passives could be swayed by competitors. | Promoters: customers who gave a score of 9 or 10 arehappyand most likely to actively recommend you and become repeat customers. Promoters are your loyal supporters and the ones who will spread the word about your company. | Your NPS is calculated by adding up the total from each category and determining its percentage of the total number surveyed, with a range from 100 to +100. The highest possible score would be 100, which would mean 100% of your customers arePromoters. At 100, all of your customers areDetractors.Passivesare essentially considered neutral. | Subtract the percentage of your detractors from the percentage of your promoters andvoil\u00e0! You have your NPS. Since any score above zero indicates more Promoters than Detractors, a score of 50 or more would be considered \"excellent\" by global standards. This indicates that your company has significantly more satisfied and loyal customers than dissatisfied ones. | \"The only path to profitable growth may lie in a company's ability to get its loyal customers to become, in effect, its marketing department.\" Frederick F. Reichheld, Harvard Business Review | When you follow your main NPS survey question with the qualifier \"What is the primary reason for your score?\" pay attention to the feedback your customers leave. From this information, you'll see why Detractors aren't happier, what's holding Passives back from being Promoters, and why Promoters love your company so much. With that feedback in hand you can develop a plan on how to improve your score. | You'll likely want to send an NPS survey every three to six months to a representative sample of your customer base, not just the ones who've purchased recently. Over time, your NPS should ideally increase. To make that happen, Reichheld recommends three steps: | \"The path to sustainable, profitable growth begins with creating more promoters and fewer detractors and making your net promoter number transparent throughout your organization. This number is the one number you need to grow. It's that simple and that profound.\" | Frederick F. Reichheld, Harvard Business Review | Despite its widespread use, the accuracy of NPS has been widely debated. Aresearch study reported in The Journal of Service Research(link takes you to an external page)looked at this debate, which centers around the question of whether NPS should be treated as being equivalent across customers. The study measured the NPS and online word of mouth messages of 189 customers. | While promoters consistently spread positive messages and detractors' messages were negative, passives\u2014who have no weight in calculating the NPS\u2014spread both positive and negative messages online. The study concluded that \"companies should flag passives for further attention and action.\" | Want to know how likely your customers are to recommend your company to others? Ask them.

            "Network Address Translation (NAT) is the modification of in transit network packets to map one IP address space to another. It is most commonly used in IP Masquerading, where a large private IP network shares a relatively small number of publicly facing IP addresses behind a router or gateway. | IETF'sRFC 791(link takes you to an external page)lays out Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) which assigned publicly accessible machines 32 bit addresses. Those addresses commonly referred to with the shorthandIP Addresses can \"only\" address a maximum of 2^32 or 4,294,967,296 devices. | While 4.3 billion addressable endpoints was once sufficient, the explosion in popularity of the internet (and recently, internet connected devices) means thatIP address exhaustion(link takes you to an external page)is inevitable. Compounding the issue, IPv4 addresses wereassigned in very large blocks(link takes you to an external page)at first, so many IPv4 addresses are effectively unusable for current devices. WhileInternet Protocol version 6(link takes you to an external page)fixes the issue with 128 bit addresses (read: 2^128, 3.4e38, or more than the number ofatoms in the universe) it isn't yet universally implemented. | NAT has become synonymous with the concept ofIP Masquerading, where the true source or destination address of a packet isn't what's listed. | Analogous to a community mailbox, IP Masquerading can allow a single gateway device such as a router to sit in front of a network of dozens or in some cases, millions of computers on a private network. That single gateway will forward the packets on to the actual destination. | At home that might mean you have a router connected to the modem, a computer in the office, 2 laptops, a tablet, and an internet connected thermostat. Other than the router, the devices might haveprivate network IP addresses(link takes you to an external page)of the form: | The router will usually have the only publicly accessible IPv4 address in the house while other devices aremasqueradedusing Network Address Translation. | NAT on a large scale means that ~4.3 billion IP addresses have sustained IPv4past4.3 billion internet connected devices.

            "A network edge is a location where a computer network interfaces with the Internet. A network connected to the Internet may have one or more network edges located in data centers throughout the world. | Many Internet providers have one or more core networks where services and content originate. These networks are often connected to a larger and more geographically distributed collection of network edges which can be used to efficiently deliver those services and content to end users. | Since network edges can be nearer to end users than the services hosted within the core network, providers often serve as much content as possible from devices in the network edge in order for the content to reach the end user with minimal delay. Content delivery networks (CDNs), which typically serve cached copies of static assets to end users, are an example of this pattern. | Twilio operates a collection of network edges around the world known as TwilioEdge Locations. These allow customers to select the site where their application's network traffic will enter and exit Twilio's platform. Selecting an Edge Location closest to an application's servers (for API traffic) or to its end users (for voice and video traffic) can result in improved reliability and reduced latency. | Twilio's Edge Locations support the following types of network traffic: | To learn more about Edge Locations and how to leverage them to optimize connectivity in your own use cases, check out the following resources: | In addition to the public Edge Locations that are available to all Twilio customers, Twilio also offers a selection of private Edge Locations for use by ourInterconnectcustomers.

Omnichannel contact centers also let agents switch between channels with a single user interface without losing context from customer interactions across channels. | The terms multichannel and omnichannel are often confused, despite meaning different things. Many companies claim to offer omnichannel communications when really it's a multichannel approach, while others recognize there's still a way to go. In fact, according to Twilio Segment'sState of PersonalizationReport(link takes you to an external page), only 35% of businesses claim to have a successful, personalized omnichannel approach. | Companies that connect with customers via multiple channels\u2014such as email, social media, chat, and telephone\u2014have a multichannel contact center. However, just because customers connect with you via multiple channels doesn't mean that their experience is seamless. | For example, an agent who connects with a customer by phone may not have any information about that customer's previous interactions on live chat. This is because channels are typically siloed in multichannel contact center channels\u2014meaning agents can't see the context from interactions customers had on other channels, which limits the level of service they can provide. | Giving your customers the ability to seamlessly switch between channels is what takes your customer journey to a whole new level. Enter the omnichannel contact center, which lets agents follow a customer conversation wherever it goes, without being boxed into one channel or spread across dozens of tabs. | When your customer can begin with achat session(link takes you to an external page)on your website and then switch to avideo(link takes you to an external page)co browsing session orvoice call(link takes you to an external page)with an agent, you can offer that customer more personalized, higher quality service. This seamless interaction across channels is the key to a great omnichannel experience. | Although the literal translation ofomniisall, an omnichannel contact center isn't necessarily operating on every possible channel (in today's technology landscape, these are constantly changing anyway). However, all the channels it does operate on are connected. This allows you to provide continuity and personalized customer service. Additionally, with an omnichannel contact center solution, agents can see the entire customer journey throughreal time dashboards. This means they can look at trends over time and by channel while tracking themetrics(link takes you to an external page)that matter to the business. | Your business can even customize the omnichannel dashboard for your specific needs and integrate it with your customer relationship management and other relevant platforms. This takes the mystery out of the customer journey by giving you visibility and extensive reporting and analytics. | Along with the visibility of the dashboard, an omnichannel approach also allows for a level of personalization that a multichannel contact center can't provide. The impact on the bottom line is undeniable\u201449% of consumers(link takes you to an external page)say they're more likely to become repeat customers after a personalized shopping experience. | Integrating your communication channels and providing seamless context throughout the customer journey\u2014especially in a complex environment like a contact center\u2014requires the rightinfrastructure(link takes you to an external page). This makes omnichannel difficult to achieve with out of the box contact centers. However, that's true of any system that requires a lengthy installation process and has limited features and integration with other platforms\u2014it can't provide the agility needed to deliver an excellent customer experience. | How do you choose a cloud based omnichannel contact center solution? For starters, look for a single interface for all channels. You also want the ability to add new channels to your contact center as those channels become popular with your customers. Finally, make sure the solution gives you complete ownership of your customer interaction data across all channels through a single dashboard to set your agents up for success.

            "An on premise contact center is a model where the customer houses all the required software and hardware. Companies that use an on premise system generally employ or contract specialized IT staff to configure, upgrade, and maintain the contact center. | Theon premise contact centerorlegacy contact centerrelies on inflexible and proprietary platforms from vendors such as Cisco, Avaya, and Genesys. And with everything companies need on site, it's no wonderMcGee Smith Analytics(link takes you to an external page)estimates about 85% of contact center agent seats will remain housed by on premise models. | However, recently, cloud based contact centers emerged to offer an alternative. Some of the most prominent features of a cloud based model are that it places core contact center services off site and customers remotely connect to the center via the internet or by phone. | But this is only the beginning for cloud vs. on premise based contact centers. Read on to learn the features, drawbacks, and differences of on premise andcloud contact centers(link takes you to an external page). | Most legacy contact centers haven't aged gracefully. After all, inflexible, expensive contact center infrastructures can't scale or adapt to evolving customer expectations and digital innovations. Even worse, with mounting operating expenses, there's little room to invest and improve. The result is often a poor customer experience that devastates businesses:56% of respondents of Twilio's 2022 State of Customer Engagement Report(link takes you to an external page)said they would no longer patronize a business after a frustrating customer support experience. | Additionally, on premise license fees are expensive. For example, the annual maintenance can cost about a quarter of the license cost, while changes to the system\u2014such as adding a new channel\u2014can become so expensive it's effectively impossible for businesses to afford. | Beyond costs, specialists trained in on premise systems are increasingly hard to find and hire. As a whole, it's more expensive to run an on premise contact center when it requires heavy virtual machine power for high availability. Fortunately, the modern cloud contact center answers the legacy problem. | While custom on premise hardware and software models provide customization, integration, reliability, and scale, these are also pricey and difficult to deploy. In fact, the benefits of custom on premise contact centers appear only when companies invest heavily in professional services or trained developers. Not to mention, with on premise contact centers, deployment of new features takes a lengthy 24 months, and every change takesan average of 9 months(link takes you to an external page). Such infrastructure can't keep up with changes in consumer behavior. | Lastly, because many on premise systems run on outdated data technology and infrastructure, which impacts reliability, performance, and security, businesses must choose a modern alternative. | Companies frustrated with existing on premise contact centers will inevitably look to augment or replace them. Some will augment existing contact centers, which typically means adding functionality and channels using a cloud based product like Twilio. And others will replace the existing contact center experience to better match business requirements. Next, we'll delve into both. | Software as a service (SaaS) models help businesses subscribe to solutions, while Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) providers offer hosted software and maintenance of servers, databases, or code. Customers access these solutions through the internet and pay for usage. And while these products offer limited customization and are quick to set up, unlike on premise contact centers, customers provide hardware. | API based companies like Twilio offer a third option: the flexibility of an on premise solution with the speed and ease of a SaaS solution. With pay as you go APIs, businesses find the annual costs of on premise maintenance alone far cheaper. Not to mention, these APIs also make businesses agile and strengthen deployment. | For companies that don't want to build with APIs and find CCaaS options too inflexible, there's another option. Platforms likeTwilio Flex(link takes you to an external page)help companies build at an unprecedented speed while customizing a unique design for specific customer and business needs. Although Twilio Flex is more intuitive than building with APIs, it's still an open platform for custom software development rather than an out of the box solution. | While on premise and cloud contact centers offer customers similar functionality, there are notable differences: | Now that you've seen the differences between on premise fromcloud contact centers(link takes you to an external page), it's clear why the future of business favors the flexibility and convenience of the cloud.Request a demo of Twilio Flex(link takes you to an external page)to learn how you can create an innovative cloud contact center that meets your growing company's needs. |  | "

            "What is Packet Loss?",
            "Packet lossrefers to the failure of packets to reach their destination on a network. Packet loss is most often a consequence of network congestion and usually caused by network equipment dropping, ignoring, misdelivering, or discarding packets. | Symptoms of packet loss are mostly application specific some use cases are more resilient to packet loss than others. Two applications particularly affected by packet loss are networked games and networked communications sessions. | In internet gaming, packet loss can cause 'jumpy' or 'jerky' movements on network dependent events. This potentially causes weird behavior with timeouts and any type of counter, causing games to be unplayable in ways similar to highlatency. | In telecommunications, high amounts of packet loss can be particularly annoying and even cause complete communications breakdowns. Dropped packets can cause the 'robot' effect on stuttering voices (on calls or in video). In video, packet loss also causes frozen frames and stuttering behavior. | Some occasional packet loss is inevitable in packet switched networks. Especially as the number of packets moving across a network increases, nodes can encounter more data than they are able to handle. At that point, traffic will be rejected or dropped as it times out. Wireless (WiFi) networks are especially prone to packet loss. | Different Twilio products use TCP/IP or UDP for traffic (and some are configurable). We'll briefly discuss how packet loss is handled with TCP/IP and UDP traffic. | In Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), all dropped packets are automatically retransmitted either after a notification (TCP Fast Retransmission) or after a timeout (TCP Retransmission). The retransmission scheme is documented inRFC 3366(link takes you to an external page). Further, TCP congestion control is laid out inRFC 2581(link takes you to an external page)and retransmission timing is inRFC 2988(link takes you to an external page). | Determining when to stop submitting packets is implementation specific, but after a certain number of unacknowledged or dropped packets a host is considered down. | With User Datagram Protocol (UDP) traffic, there is no automatic transmission of lost packages. UDP is used in real time streaming applications which can deal with some amount of packet loss (or out of order reception). If an application requires UDP retransmission it must implement it on its own or switch to TCP/IP. | Twilio'sProgrammable Voice(link takes you to an external page)has a suite of tools which can monitor network and call quality. We call this packageVoice Insights(link takes you to an external page). | Insights can alert on (and log) high amounts of packet loss, along with other common causes of poor communications quality such aslatencyorjitter.

            "What is Post Dial Delay?",
            "Post dial delay (PDD) is the measurement of how long it takes for a calling party to hear a ringback tone after initiating a call. Technically it is the delta between theSIP INVITEand a180 Ringingor183 Session Progressresponse. | Callers who experience post dial delay will report long waits before hearing ringing. In extreme cases high post dial delay will be reported as dead air, one way audio, or dropped calls since the calling party has no indication that the call has been properly established, or whether the destination has answered. | Tolerance for post dial delay varies widely by geography. In North America most users will notice post dial delay of ~5 seconds, but in some locations like South Africa post dial delay of 10 seconds or more is common and even 15 seconds of silence before hearing ringing can go without remark by callers. | Most post dial delay is due to improper SIP signaling response from destination networks due to different interpretations of the SIP RFC. For example, in general a180 Ringingresponse from a destination indicates that the calling party network should play the caller whatever their local ringback tone is and a183 Session Progressfrom a destination includes specific audio in the SDP to be played back to the caller; however, in some cases a destination may try to provide specific ringback with a180 Ringingresponse, or neglect to provide one with a183 Session Progressresponse. Further, in some cases the ringback provided may be silence. | Post dial delay can also be experienced when calling geographically remote destinations from the caller. Non geographic destinations like satellite phones are also prone to greater post dial delay. | Twilio's Super Network actively monitors our carrier partners for increases in post dial delay and will proactively notify and resolve problems that are detected without action required from customers. | In some cases calls to a specific destination may encounter post dial delay that is not significant enough in aggregate to alert Super Network to the issue; in these instances customers can reach out to Twilio Support for assistance in investigating the issue and escalating to carrier partners if appropriate. | Post dial delay can be proactively monitored by customers using theVoice Insights DashboardandVoice Insights Advanced Features Call Summary API. |  | "

As a result, various jurisdictions have passed legislation to limit the use, distribution, and accessibility of PII, while allowing companies who need it to manage the data safely. | As PII (or personal data) is a legal concept rather than a technical concept, legislation around PII varies across different jurisdictions. Global privacy laws likeGDPR(link takes you to an external page)in the European Union, sectoral laws likeHIPAA(link takes you to an external page)andPCI(link takes you to an external page)in the United States, state laws likeCCPA(link takes you to an external page),CPRA(link takes you to an external page),CalOPPA(link takes you to an external page), state and regional data breach laws, and other regulations control what defines PII.

Platforms offer the ability to build within an existing technical framework, decreasing both development time and cost. | There are many different types of platforms, including computing platforms like Apple iOS and Microsoft Windows, social platforms like Facebook and WeChat, and marketplace platforms like eBay and AirBnB. | Twilio is a technology platform, like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure, which provides building blocks that are used in other technology products. Technology platforms are usually not visible to the end users of a product built on the platform. For example, while Netflix runs its services on top of AWS, Netflix's video watching users never see or interact with AWS. | Likewise, an end user of Lyft's ridesharing service doesn't see or interact directly with Twilio, even though Lyft uses the Twilio platform to communicate with their users. This type of platform is also known asplatform as a service, or PaaS. The provider, such as Twilio, hosts applications on its infrastructure, and developers pay for what they use. | Specifically, Twilio is acloud communications platform. This is sometimes referred to ascommunications platform as a service, or CPaaS. The term CPaaS emerged when companies like Twilio started offeringapplication program interfaces(APIs)\u2014a more developer friendly and lower cost option to integrate communications capabilities likevoice(link takes you to an external page),messaging(link takes you to an external page),email(link takes you to an external page), andvideo(link takes you to an external page)directly into software applications. | Rather than building their own communications infrastructure from scratch, businesses that use cloud based APIs from CPaaS vendors add real time communications into their applications with a few lines of code. Unlike traditional communications infrastructure, communications built on a cloud communications platform are available without the burdens of capacity planning, carrier contracts, telecom hardware integration, and fragmented security. | Cloud communications platforms like Twilio bring the world of communications to every web and mobile developer in the programming languages they already use. Twilio can power solutions from a large, complex contact center to replacing a legacy corporate phone system and building SMS notifications into a supply chain management app. Without separate equipment, protocols, traditional infrastructure, telecom contracts, and software to deal with, the focus can be on building and iterating on the right solution for the task. | Cloud communications platforms operate with the latest security practices used by the largest banks and multinational companies. Strong encryption, role based access control, and signature validation protect the experience. Dedicated security experts are always improving security with incident response teams proactively monitoring and patching potential vulnerabilities around the clock. | Cloud communications platforms offer a distributed, self healing infrastructure to eliminate maintenance windows and guarantee uptime. Users get the benefit of dedicated communications engineers who constantly monitor and optimize for changing traffic patterns. Each service performed is always transparent and customers are backed by a service level agreement (SLA). | With geographically distributed hosting, horizontally scalable architecture, and thousands of carrier connections worldwide, cloud communication platforms present the opportunity to be truly global immediately. Local communications infrastructure and local connections in every geography are no longer required, allowing for vastly wider reach and the ability to scale as quickly as a company demands. | Unlike traditional infrastructure, cloud communication platforms don't focus on peak usage estimates and preparing for extra capacity that may or may not be used.

At the most basic level, a PBX connects communications devices such as hubs, switches, telephone adapters, routers, and phone sets. Size and complexity vary with each PBX. There are at home PBX systems that upgrade a traditional phone line to cloud hosted programs as well as complex and expensive corporate communications systems owned and operated by an individual enterprise. | Note: PBX is sometimes written PABX (Private Automatic Branch Exchange). While the first PBX systems required a human operator, almost all modern PBX systems are now automated. 'PBX' is still the term most commonly used to refer to this kind of system. | A PBX system makes it affordable to use more than one phone line in an organization. Managing incoming and outgoing calls, a PBX makes it possible to split a single phone line into several private lines identified by extensions (usually assigned 3 or 4 digit numbers). Not only does this allow a customer to reach anyone in an office through a single phone number, but it also grants the group free internal phone communication since multiple unique phone lines are no longer a requirement. PBX systems also empowerVoIP communication. | PBX systems perform four main call processing duties: | While it's safe to assume that all PBXes offer the above features, most modern PBX systems provide a whole host of other calling features and capabilities (though each PBX may differ in which features they offer). Some commonly provided PBX features include: | The arrival of IP telephony (VoIP) changed a lot about PBX. While PBX systems were initially analog and built on telephone lines and switches, IP PBX systems use VoIP technology and IP networks to channel calls. | IP PBX is the preferred flavor of modern PBX, switching calls between a VoIP user and a traditional phone user or between two standard phone users. Not only are IP PBX systems feature rich, but they also don't require separate networks for voice and data communications. With IP PBX, a single user has access to the internet, VoIP communications, and traditional phone communications through one line. Most, though not all, PBX systems today are IP PBX. | Also known as Virtual PBX, a Hosted PBX delivers PBX functionality as a service through the cloud. Various companies offer PBXes at a monthly cost, and all users need are their telephone sets and routers. While Hosted PBX systems generally cannot be tailored to more complex business needs, they are a great option for those running a small business due to their relatively low cost and the fact that they don't require any upfront investment. | If your business uses a PBX and you're interested in integrating your system with Twilio, we're here to help! | Twilio'sProgrammable Voice SIPallows you to use your existing SIP communications infrastructure to initiate SIP sessions with Twilio.

Most of these OSPNS allow push notifications to include text, images, app badges, and sounds. The OSPNS routes the notification from the application provider to the application user's device. | To add push notifications to an application, the application publisher registers with the push notification service of the OS for which they're developing.

Using sentiment algorithms, developers and brand managers can gain insights into customer opinions about a topic. | Customer opinion can make or break a brand's success, and the decision to monitor it can mean the difference between a well timed course correction or a missed opportunity. Sentiment can also inform marketing and product strategy by revealing chances to reframe the customer experience. | Automated sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for gauging customer opinion at scale. Rather than relying on humans to read and evaluate large volumes of text, an algorithm can process and score sentiment rapidly and efficiently. | You can do sentiment analysis by setting up a dictionary based model. First, create a set of predetermined words with positive and negative values (or find apre made dictionary(link takes you to an external page)). Then, write a function that parses text, checks for the presence of those words, and uses the preset sentiment values to calculate the overall sentiment of the text. You can layer on additional functionality by including regular expressions and additional code to check for patterns that resemble sentence structures. This rule based approach can be quick to implement but may require significant work to derive a nuanced analysis. | Machine learning (ML) algorithms such as theNaive Bayes Classifier(link takes you to an external page)can be used for a more data driven approach to opinion mining. These models are fed sample datasets and trained to recognize positive, negative, and neutral opinions when they encounter a new piece of text. | Most comprehensive sentiment algorithms will cover: | Advanced approaches can discern the subject and object of opinions, parse complex statements (\"I used to prefer shopping in person, but now I love buying online\"), and account for slang (\"that move was really sick!\"). | Twilio has partnered withIBM Watson(link takes you to an external page)to feature theMessage Sentiment Add on(link takes you to an external page)for Programmable SMS.

Applications are broken up into individual functions that can be invoked and scaled individually. | Hosting a software application on the internet usually involves managing some kind of server infrastructure. Typically, this means a virtual or physical server that needs to be managed, as well as the operating system and other web server hosting processes required for your application to run. Using a virtual server from a cloud provider such asAmazon(link takes you to an external page)orMicrosoft(link takes you to an external page)does mean the elimination of the physical hardware concerns, but still requires some level of management of the operating system and the web server software processes. | With a serverless architecture, you focus purely on the individual functions in your application code. Services such asTwilio Functions(link takes you to an external page),AWS Lambda(link takes you to an external page)andMicrosoft Azure Functions(link takes you to an external page)take care of all the physical hardware, virtual machine operating system, and web server software management. You only need to worry about your code. | PaaS, or Platform as a Service, products such asHeroku(link takes you to an external page),Azure Web Apps(link takes you to an external page)andAWS Elastic Beanstalk(link takes you to an external page)offer many of the same benefits as Serverless (sometimes called Function as a Service or FaaS). They do eliminate the need for management of server hardware and software. The primary difference is in the way you compose and deploy your application, and therefore the scalability of your application. | With PaaS, your application is deployed as a single unit and is developed in the traditional way using some kind of web framework like ASP.NET, Flask, Ruby on Rails, Java Servlets, etc. Scaling is only done at the entire application level. You can decide to run multiple instances of your application to handle additional load. | With FaaS, you compose your application into individual, autonomous functions. Each function is hosted by the FaaS provider and can be scaled automatically as function call frequency increases or decreases. This turns out to be a very cost effective way of paying for compute resources. You only pay for the times that your functions get called, rather than paying to have your application always on and waiting for requests on so many different instances. | You should especially consider using a serverless provider if you have a small number of functions that you need hosted. If your application is more complex, a serverless architecture can still be beneficial, but you will need to architect your application very differently. This may not be feasible if you have an existing application. It may make more sense to migrate small pieces of the application into serverless functions over time. | Using a product likeTwilio Functions(link takes you to an external page)is especially helpful for builders and developers wanting to implement a Twilio solution.

Messages longer than 160 characters are automatically split into parts (called \"segments\") and then re assembled when they are received. Message concatenation allows you to send long SMS messages, but this increases your per message cost, because SMS are billed per segment. | The 160 character limit is for messages encoded using theGSM 7character set. Messages not encoded with GSM 7 are limited to 70 characters. For detail on how these character limits change on concatenated (multi segment) messages, see below. | Twilio's platform supports long messages up to 1600 characters across all Programmable Messaging channels, including SMS. However, for SMS messaging, Twilio recommends sending messages that are no more than 320 characters to ensure the best deliverability and user experience. Seethis article(link takes you to an external page)for details. | When you send anSMSmessage containing more than 160 characters, the message is split into smaller messages for transmission. Large messages are split into 153 character \"segments\" and sent individually, then re assembled by the recipient's device. The effective character limit per segment is 153 rather than 160, because a data header must be included with each segment to ensure correct re assembly. | For example, a 161 character message will be sent as two messages: one with 153 characters and a second with eight characters. | If you includenon GSM 7 characters, such as Chinese script or emoji, in SMS messages, those messages have to be sent using theUCS 2encoding. Messages containingone or moreUCS 2 characters can contain up to 70 characters in a single, non segmented message. UCS 2 messages of more than 70 characters will be split into 67 character segments. | If you choose, Twilio's Smart Encoding feature canreplace certain non GSM characters with equivalent GSM characters,to reduce message cost when possible. For example, angled quotation marks \"\" are not in the GSM character set, but Twilio Smart Encoding will replace them automatically with straight quotation marks \"\". | Twilio bills SMS for every message segment sent. So, for example, if you need to send a message that is 140 characters long and contains only one non GSM character, you (or Twilio Smart Encoding) can avoid the cost of a second message segment by removing that UCS 2 character. | Toll Free multi segment SMS messages sent to the US or Canada have a total of 152 characters available per segment for GSM encoded messages and 66 for UCS 2 messages. | The Short Messaging Service (SMS) is a standardized communication protocol that enables devices to send and receive brief text messages. It was designed to \"fit in between\" other signalling protocols, which is why SMS message length is limited to 160 7 bit characters, i.e., 1120 bits, or 140 bytes. SMS was first standardized as part of the1985 GSM protocol(link takes you to an external page)and was subsequently codified into theSMPP signalling protocol(link takes you to an external page)that transmits SMS. | But things get tricky because GSM 7, the original character set designed for SMS, can only encompass 128 different characters, thanks to that 7 bit limit. So if you want to include characters from extended Latin or non Latin scripts, you'll need to use UCS 2. | A common mistake is to inadvertently use a UCS 2 character. GSM 7 isn't a supported character set in many text editors, which may replace GSM 7 compatible characters with characters outside of GSM 7. For example, if your text editor changes\"to\u201c\u2014 a 'curly' or 'smart' quote mark \u2014 you will have a UCS 2 character in your message and that will reduce the character limit from 160 to 70. | We recommend that you check any messages that you plan to send frequently usingour Message Segment calculator(link takes you to an external page)before you send them. This tool can flag any characters that would force the message to be sent using UCS 2 encoding, so you can decide whether to remove those characters and reduce the cost per message. | You can see whether any Twilio SMS message sent from your account was encoded as UCS 2 or GSM 7 by viewing the message in your Console logs. |  | "

            "What is SMS Delivery or Deliverability?",
            "SMS Deliveryis a measure of the percentage of outgoing SMS and MMS messages which are received at their intended destination. While sometimes referring to the status of a single message, SMS delivery usually is a rate of delivered versus intended messages and summarized as an 'SMS Delivery Rate.' | Whether sending a text message from a phone or through anSMS API, the nature of theshort messaging servicemeans some percentage of SMS messages will never be delivered. | As opposed to thumbing out a text on a phone, SMSes sent programmatically through an SMS Gateway have an advantage; application logic can verify delivery, increasing total SMS Deliverability by working around issues with sent messages. Through choosing reliable API partners (Twilio's current SLAs withProgrammable SMS(link takes you to an external page)are here),implementing read receipts(link takes you to an external page)or falling back to a different processor number(link takes you to an external page), you can keep your SMS Deliverability rate close to 100%. | Twilio's Messaging Services'Fallback to Long Codefeature can automatically fall back to long codes on SMS delivery failure | Of course even with best practices in place, you'll still have some failures. Here's how to measure your success... and how to improve it. | There is no standard time frame for measuring SMS or text message deliverability, but most often rates are quotedannually,quarterly, ordaily. The equation then becomes: | TOTAL MESSAGES DELIVERED / MESSAGES INTENDED | It's important to note that deliverabilityisn't measured by total API calls or messages sent. Message Deliverability strictly measures how many messages are delivered versus the number intended in a defined time frame. | This key difference means that your logic can implement fallbacks and use messaging auditing features to increase deliverability, even if that requires additional API calls and redundant logic. As SMS deliverability strictly focuses on intention versus result, Twilio can help you increase deliverability through our value added services and your business logic and code. | There are quite a few places where SMS and MMS delivery might fail, especially as messages move through the interfaces between pieces of infrastructure. | Although not an exhaustive list, common failure vectors include: | The device endpoint is an especially common vector for deliverability issues. Sometimes roaming devices or quickly moving devices do not acknowledge SMS or MMS reception, leading to messages being received more than once, or never received at all. (As with multiple API calls, messages delivered multiple times should only be counted as one delivered message.) Additionally, sometimes end devices or numbers just can't receive SMSes Twilio's Phone Number Lookup(link takes you to an external page)can help solve this problem. | Note that sometimes deliverability issues are deliberate for example, messages judged 'spam' may be blocked by our carrier partners. Twiliolists message error codes here. | Invalid numbers are the most common reason for message delivery problems. Changed (or fake) phone numbers won't reach their intended destination, decreasing your message delivery score. | As listed above, there are quite a few SMS delivery failure modes but not all are in your control. For your application, the content and meta content as well as any recovery logic are reasonable places to improve your deliverability. | With these best practices, you'll ensure high SMS delivery rates. High quality content and graceful exception handling will ensure you see the highest possible deliverability. | If you still would like more help with deliverability,talk to Twilio sales(link takes you to an external page) we have loads of experience helping customers perfect their SMS Marketing efforts. | Related Content |  | "

While often used as a marketing tool to increase the percentage of returning visitors, SMS notifications are very useful for organization and public safety purposes as well. | Because of the enviable open and interaction rates of text messages, using SMS as a delivery channel for notifications is a compelling option. Since SMSes work as apushto devices, you won't have to rely on people checking in on a site, app, dashboard or other channels to keep apprised of events,ETA updates, or changes to plans. Additionally, the out of band aspect of SMSes is essential for public safety purposes (e.g., police activity, fires, or natural disasters), as well as maintaining a backup channel in case primary means of communications fail. | In marketing, SMS notifications increase the stickiness and interaction of your site for opted in customers (local laws vary, check with your legal team about your local opt in regulations). Whether notifying people of sales and providing coupons, keeping the conversation going on social networks, or directing people to a retail store, SMS notifications are the secret weapon for your business's engagement. | SMS Notifications also have a pivotal role in logistics. Whether sending event updates, keeping people apprised of schedule (or even providing support) at live events, or for notifying the proper teams when bad things occur, SMS is a great channel to tie everything together.

            "An SMS tracker is software that uncovers detailed information about the delivery and content of text and picture messages. It allows anyone to analyze an individual message or group of messages to see delivery patterns, encoding details, and error conditions. | From the moment you (or your application) kick off a new message to when that message reaches the recipient's phone screen, there are many possible points of failure. We take for granted that anSMS or MMS(link takes you to an external page)arrives quickly and unscathed. Yet it almost always does. In each case, that means the message was sent correctly by the handset or application, was properly encoded and segmented for the downstream carrier, navigated the global carrier network without incident, and was assembled and displayed correctly on the recipient's handset. If something went wrong along the way, an SMS tracker provides the insight needed to quickly diagnose what happened. It can determine when a delay or failure condition occurred and what part of the communication chain was responsible. | Delivery Status | An SMS tracker provides real time information when a message is queued, sent, delivered successfully, or not delivered by the carrier. It provides useful error information for delivery failures, such as when: | With Twilio, you can directly notify your app aboutSMS(link takes you to an external page)delivery status via awebhook, which is a user defined HTTP callback. The followingguidewill show you how to set it up. | Detailed information on an individual message is also available through a web based Console view. It might look like the following: | Message Content | Whether your message contains alphanumeric characters, emoji, or pictures, the content of the message can dictate how it's sent (e.g. using SMS or MMS) and the encoding mechanism used. Different carriers around the world use different encoding methods and this can sometimes impact whether your message looks the same way to the recipient as it does when you sent it. | With an SMS Tracker, you can learn about how message content was formatted or encoded and can log the actual text and picture content for compliance. | It's even possible to retrieve sentiment and keyword analysis about the messages with services that augment an SMS API likeIBM Watson(link takes you to an external page). This way you can gain insight into what's said across a group of messages without having to read each one. | Conversation Tracking | You can also trackSMS conversationsbetween two specific phone numbers using HTTP cookies. To do this, you must create a unique cookie for each to/from phone number pair and store the unique cookie messages sent between that pair of numbers. So, for example, the cookie for messages sent between 650 555 2222 and 212 555 9999 will be different than a cookie used in a text conversation between 408 555 3333 and 925 555 1111. | User Actions | While infrastructure can provide a wealth of information about delivery and content, there's no substitute for direct user feedback. Twilio, for example, programmatically gathers information about user actions that relate to an SMS. So, using Twilio's API, you could build an application in which: | You can then process these actions to locate network issues and improve message delivery rates. | An SMS tracker uses network data, various monitoring techniques, and direct user feedback data to improve delivery and give you a complete view of the messages you send and receive. It exposes the data to you, and helps inform carrier routing decisions so your messages are always delivered quickly and reliably. |  | "

The TLS protocol, like its predecessor SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), is primarily designed to enable reliable, authenticated, and secure communication between two or more computer applications. In modern browsers, connections secured with TLS are usually indicated by a lock icon next to the URL. | We won't go too deep here (there are whole books written on the subject!) but at its most basic, cryptography is the study and practice of techniques for secret communication between two or more parties. Everything from kids' invisible ink to the Enigma encryption machine used during WWII are parts of cryptography. | When it comes to the internet, usually cryptography is applied to creating sets of rules (protocols) that allow secure, encrypted communication over a network. | Sending data over a network is like sending a postcard. Once you've mailed the postcard, there are a lot of people who have the opportunity to read what you've written...postal workers, mail thieves, anyone who gets their hands on the card. If you want to send something private on a postcard, you need to obscure the message. The same is true of data sent over the internet: it is possible for unintended audiences to peek at that data while it is in transport. | In the early days of the internet, there were fewer people with the access, motivation, or the knowledge to snoop on this data in transit. But as the internet became a larger part of daily life, internet users needed a way to ensure data security over a network. | In the early 1990s, Netscape developed the first transport layer protocol designed for network security \u2014 Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The internet widely adopted this protocol and it saw numerous iterations over the next few years, until it was completely overhauled to become TLS in 2006. Today, TLS is a key requirement of most network connections and SSL has been completely deprecated. | There are two primary types of cryptography we'll talk about here: \"asymmetric\" and \"symmetric\". Asymmetric cryptography (or \"public key cryptography(link takes you to an external page)\") is facilitated by pairs of keys, one public and one private. The message recipient shares their public key with a message sender. The message sender uses the recipient's public key to encrypt their message. When the recipient gets the message, they use their private key to decrypt the message. Other than verifying that the public key belongs to the legitimate recipient (see Certificate Authorities, below), no secure key exchange is required. However, generating and using the public key is slow because the key needs to be very large to support this scheme. | Symmetric cryptography only requires one shared key that is used to encrypt and decrypt messages back and forth. This scheme is faster because the key can be smaller, but presents a kind of chicken and egg problem. How do you securely share a secret key to enable encrypted communication? | TLS uses a combination of these schemes to solve the key exchange problem and facilitate the private connections needed for sending sensitive data. | Certificate Authorities(link takes you to an external page)(CAs) are an important part of the TLS protocol. They are entities (likeLetsEncrypt(link takes you to an external page)) that issue digital certificates which validate that a public key is owned by a legitimate organization. CAs act as trusted, independent third parties giving clients assurance that they are communicating with the right system, and that all parties involved will comply with the rest of the TLS protocol. | TheTLS handshake(link takes you to an external page)is the start of secure communication over a network. It is a series of steps in which the client and server negotiate the parameters of their secure connection and generate and exchange their symmetric encryption keys. Here is a simplified overview of the steps involved in a TLS handshake: | As of June 2019, the Twilio REST API only supports connections that use TLS v1.2.

In web authentication, this is commonly something you know and something you have. | Also known as multi factor authentication (MFA), two factor authentication is a common authentication best practice to increase account security normally provided by passwords. Passwords became a de facto standard for online authentication because unlike a possession factor, you can'tlosea password. | According to the websitehaveibeenpwned.com(link takes you to an external page), guessable passwords like 123456 are still incredibly common. That password, 123456, has been seen in data breaches over24 million times. To make matters worse, a2019 Google study(link takes you to an external page)shows that 64% of people admit to reusing passwords across multiple sites. This is a problem because even if someone has a complex password, if they're reusing it for many sites, a data breach atMySpace(link takes you to an external page)orAdobe(link takes you to an external page)could lead to the user's account getting breached onyour company'ssite through a process known as credential stuffing. | Things like password reuse, poorly encrypted passwords, social engineering, and leaked databases make even a secure password vulnerable.

Conflicts between character encodings also meant that two encodings could use the same number for two different characters, or even multiple numbers for the same character. Any computer would need to support multiple encodings, and this system created a high risk of data corruption when data passed through different machines or between different encodings. | In October 1991, theUnicode Consortium's goal(link takes you to an external page)to \"unify the many hundreds of conflicting ways to encode characters, replacing them with a single, universal standard\" was realized with the publication of version 1.0 of the Unicode Standard. | Unicode provides a unique number for every character including punctuation marks, mathematical symbols, technical symbols, arrows, and characters making up non Latin alphabets such as Thai, Chinese, or Arabic script. Since its inception, Unicode has been adopted by all modern software providers, allowing the transportation of data through devices, applications, and platforms without corruption.

An SMS allows up to 160 characters from the GSM 7 character set (see more on theSMS Character Limit), which includes all Latin characters A Z, digits 0 9, plus a few special characters. Unicode handles any known character but also takes up more SMS space than GSM's 7 bit binary code.

Instead, VoIP sends voice data as data packets that are delivered over a packet switched network with media delivery protocols that allow callers to speak and listen as if they were talking over a PSTN connection. | VoIP is particularly popular in contact centers for its cheaper price point and tight integration capabilities with CRM systems.

This is known as a \"soft\" phone. | VoIP also hasfunctionality advantages(link takes you to an external page)over conventional telephony. Incoming calls can be routed to a VoIP phone, no matter where in the network it is physically plugged in, allowing \"phones\" to be anywhere with a stable internet connection.

They are triggered by some event in a web application and can facilitate integrating different applications or third party APIs, like Twilio. | Want to learn more about how Twilio uses webhooks?Check out theWebhooks Hub in our developer documentation! | Twilio uses webhooks to let your application know when events happen, such as receiving an SMS message or getting an incoming phone call. When the event occurs, Twilio makes an HTTP request (usually aPOSTor aGET(link takes you to an external page)) to the URL you configured for the webhook. Twilio's request will include details of the event such as the incoming phone number or the body of an incoming message. Many other modern web services like GitHub and Slack also make use of webhooks to communicate events. | To handle a webhook you only need to build a small web application that can accept the HTTP requests. If you already have a web application set up, handling a webhook usually involves adding a new URL to your application. | If you don't already have a web application, almost all server side programming languages offer frameworks to help you build one. Examples include: | Webhooks can also be handled by serverless frameworks likeAWS Lambda(link takes you to an external page)andAzure Functions(link takes you to an external page). Really anything that can receive and reply to an HTTP request will do. Got aRaspberry Pi(link takes you to an external page)lying around? | Whichever framework and language you choose, webhooks function the same for every Twilio application. An HTTP request will be made to aURI(link takes you to an external page)that you provide to Twilio. Your application performs whatever logic you feel necessary read/write from a database, integrate with another API, or perform some computation then replies to Twilio with a TwiML response with the instructions you want Twilio to perform. | Check out these tutorials that show you how to work with webhooks on a variety of platforms: |  | "

Messages over websockets can be provided in any protocol, freeing the application from the sometimes unnecessary overhead of HTTP requests and responses (including headers, cookies, and other artifacts). But most critical is the ability to deliver downstream (server to client) messages to connected clients. In the browser, for instance, the same thing was once only possible by polling a server resource, which is a comparatively racy, high latency, and bandwidth intensive affair. | WebSockets are available on many platforms, including the most common browsers and mobile devices. They're often applied to solve problems of millisecond accurate state synchronization andpublish subscribe messaging(link takes you to an external page), both of which leverage Websockets' provision for downstream pushes. A challenge of operating a WebSocket based system is the maintenance of a stateful gateway on the backend. A WebSocket is erected by making a common HTTP request to that server with anUpgradeheader, which the server (after authenticating and authorizing the client) should confirm in its response. After this, the connection remains established between that physical client server pair; if at some point the service needs to be redeployed or the load redistributed, its WebSocket connections needs to be re established. | At Twilio, we use WebSockets to connect our SDKs to our backend in several of our products: |  | "
