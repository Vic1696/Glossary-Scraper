CXaaS: Customer Experience as a Service,https://exotel.com/glossary/cxaas-customer-experience-as-a-service/,"Today, CX has become the differentiating factor for customers. If customers have a single bad",What is CXaaS?,"What is CXaaS?: Customer Experience as a Service or CXaaS is a cloud based solution that links your omnichannel, AI, and analytics in a structured manner to give businesses a holistic view of their entire customer touchpoints – from first touch base to post sales support. CXaaS is different from conventional customer experience methods. It goes a step beyond and becomes a hub of information for businesses to better their CX at every step. This approach enables organizations to streamline and scale their operations, strategize transformation and estimate operational tools cost. | Adoption of CXaaS & Market share: According to theGlobal Insight Services Report:The Customer Experience as a Service (CXaaS) market is anticipated to expand from $9.8 billion in 2023 to $28.4 billion by 2033, at a CAGR of 11.2%. The customer support segment dominates with a45% market share, driven by the increasing demand for personalized service solutions. Analytics and insights hold 30% of the market, reflecting the growing need for data driven decision making.  | Why is CXaaS important for businesses?: To improve and enhance CX, organizations often outsource CXaaS platforms that help them achieve their desired outcomes. This approach not only leads to significant cost savings but also enables organizations to save the time of going through the entire customer data and directly leverage the customer insights. This direct customer information enables businesses to optimize customer journeys at every touchpoint, making every customer interaction personalized, empathic and above everything else, heard. The ability to know the customer and provide assistance and relevant suggestions/recommendations at every step helps businesses stay flexible without disrupting CX – enhancing key performance indicators like improving first call resolution, average handling time and query turnaround time. | Difference between CXaaS | CPaaS | CCaaS: In the previous segments we have established the importance of CXaaS, now let’s also look at the two more equally important aspects that drive CX. Let’s zoom in on how they are different from each other. While CXaaS is more about seeing the bigger picture,CCaaSzeroes in on making contact centres more effective. Whereas,CPaaSprovides tools to integrate communication capabilities directly into applications. Each one targets a specific aspect of customer engagement, contributing to a unified customer experience when combined. Let’s take an in depth view of each: | CXaaS (Customer Experience as a Service):: CXaaS is all about crafting exceptional experiences across theentirecustomer journey. Think of it as the secret sauce that boosts customer satisfaction and loyalty. | CCaaS (Contact Center as a Service):: Focused on making contact centres efficient and effective, CCaaS handles everything from resolving issues to supporting customers when they need help. | CPaaS (Communication Platform as a Service):: What It Does:CPaaS equips apps and platforms with communication capabilities—like voice, video, and messaging—so businesses can connect with customers in meaningful ways. | How does CXaaS work?: CXaaS often includes a detailed strategy that consists of a few key elements: At the heart of CXaaS lies omnichannel capability. This approach combines multiple channels of communication and brings everything on a unified platform so you as a brand can respond to customers without losing the communication thread. This ensures a consistent customer experience across channels. Agents often end up handling routine queries to complex ones as many businesses are now heavily investing in AI. As per aGartnerreport:In an early 2024 Gartner poll, 40% of respondents said GenAI has been deployed in more than three business units. Customer service and marketing are the primary business functions using GenAI. GenAI is now more than capable enough to handle routine tasks, take decisions and perform complex tasks autonomously leaving agents to handle more complex queries that require human intervention and/or supervision. Many organizations take time to go through endless customer data which offers customer insights. This is an important process for any business but also time consuming. CXaaS platforms offer insightful customer analytics, information on customer buying patterns, predict future customer issues and so on. These analytics help organizations make better decisions that directly impact the customer experience and improve customer satisfaction scores. For any given business, scalability is one of the primary things. CXaaS platforms are dynamic and support the growing requirement of organizations to meet the demand without disrupting customer experiences. | How to choose the right CXaaS partner for your business: Selecting the right CXaaS partner for your organization is extremely crucial to ensure success. While selecting the right CXaaS, you can look for: Organizations need to look at the CX strategy that is completely aligned with their business goals and set the expectations right. Clearly define your CX objectives, current pain points, specific capabilities, integration capability with your existing platform, and implementation timeframe. Most CXaaS platforms today are built on top of GenAI and experiment with open LLMs to SMLs to ensure accurate responses in a humanized manner. Understand how your organization can leverage their AI capabilities and streamline operations. When you start evaluating CXaaS partners you also have to understand their customization capabilities. You need a partner who can understand your unique challenges and provide solutions that are curated for your organization. Prioritize a partner that can offer customization as per your challenges and evolve as your growing needs change. This will help in creating a long term CX strategy. Verification of adherence to security level is extremely crucial. Your CXaaS partner should offer enterprise grade security to ensure robust security measures. You should also look for partners who offer dedicated account management, platform training and support. | How Exotel is redefining CX?: Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) is at the forefront of the customer experience as a service (CXaaS) market.
